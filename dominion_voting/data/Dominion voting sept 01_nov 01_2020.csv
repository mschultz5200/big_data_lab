I would trip over my own feet in the rush. Any of the powerful, popular Democrats? Probably, though I would hate to do it - I really don't like the man. He just happens to understand, better than any Democrat on the Hill (including Biden) what our country needs, and it isn't more socialism, it isn't more illegal aliens, it isn't more supporting the world and it isn't more freebies from Uncle Sam.

At his age, with his wealth, and plenty of younger people to carry the torch (even his own children) I’d think he’d be a fool to even entertain the idea. He may be narcissistic but that would just be insane! Since when did America decide the only people qualified to be president have to be candidates for geriatric care! Really, if the only way to get a young president is for a senile president to pick a young VP this country needs to start over! reply report 91 Ken Burgess posted 2 months ago in reply to this No. I am not saddened by the end of the Trump Administration. I am disheartened that a such a stooge for the very worst that DC has to offer the American people is transplanting him. This incoming Administration, along with a Congress controlled by Pelosi and Schumer are going to be ruthless on the American people. And as if on cue, there is this headline: ""AOC Calls For Listing Trump Supporters For Future"" reply report 93 GA Anderson posted 2 months ago in reply to this Ha! I agree with you. I would not vote for Trump in 2024. regardless of who is opponent is. I vote for a candidate, not against one. Unfortunately, for me, I was not able to cast a valid presidential vote in this election. I could not vote for Pres. Trump and I could not vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, so I voted my down-ballot selections. I actually sat at the ballot marking table for at least a full 15 minutes trying to convince myself to vote for Pres. Trump because I do like his policy achievements and the angst he has brought to the 'business as usual' politicians of DC, but I couldn't do it. So I didn't vote for a presidential choice. And I feel pissed that I didn't have that choice because of what my options were. Relative to your Pelosi/Schumer thought I think both will have a struggle holding onto their current positions. As many pundits are saying, I think the 2020 election results are going to re-align the Democrat party, with the AOC and Squad factions losing power. From my lips to God's ear. GA reply report 91 Ken Burgess posted 2 months ago in reply to this I believe this was about more than DC politics getting back to normal. This was about resuming the path the nation and the world had been on prior to Trump and Brexit and a few smaller EU nations going Nationalistic. Trump was the major Domino that had to fall, now Biden will facilitate Agenda 2030, the Global Compact for Migration, the Paris Accord, etc. and the concept of America as a Nation, as an independent, sovereign, unique entity that inspired the world and led it for the last 75 years will be over with. A very different world is being born, one that is hard to discern because we are living in this particular moment, technology is transforming our world, there is no place for individualism or independence in the new world coming into existence... there will be Social Credit, Digital Wallets, 24/7 monitorization, and AI making things like driving obsolete. This also solidifies China's ascension as global leader and America stepping back from center stage. Biden and the rest in DC will go right back to being sycophants. reply report 86 gmwilliams posted 2 months ago in reply to this Exactly, Biden is nothing but a career politician. Trump was an outsider & on that basis, Trump was a threat to both powers that be. Both parties were threatened by Trump. Trump was his own person & was never a brownnoser. He cared about America & her people. Biden just want to be a politician. People voted for Biden to get back at Trump- that's all. reply report 97 FatFreddysCat posted 2 months ago Good Lord, no. reply report 77 Live to Learn posted 2 months ago Hard to say.

I voted for him this time and he is showing me that I voted for someone who is not a true Republican or a Conservative by his actions. What do I expect, though.

Why should Republicans fight this fight right? We always take the high road! It's the Dems that do things like spend 4 years telling us that our President is illegitimate.... If you see his questioning this, the Republicans (who aren't appeasing hand-wringers) questioning this ""as a joke"", then you see half of your fellow countrymen as a joke. All those who believe in the integrity of elections(every citizen should care) We MUST get to the bottom of this....or we will never be able to trust a single election again, in this Country. reply report 83 PrettyPanther posted 8 weeks ago in reply to this As I have said from the beginning, let him prove it. That's not working out so well for him so far. While I might roll my eyes at the massive waste of time and money bringing over two dozen cases to court, almost all of which have already been dismissed or ruled against, he has a right to his challenges as long has he is doing so legally and ethically. I hope you and other fraud believers have donated as much of your life savings as you can spare to his election fraud fund, as this is an expensive endeavor and I have no doubt you and others consider it vital to our democracy. reply report 91 Stevennix2001 posted 8 weeks ago in reply to this Well regardless of what happens, I can only see this dividing our country more. If Trump pulls a miracle out of his ass, and somehow gets the election results overturned in court, then your going to have a lot of people on the left saying how the Republicans stole the election this year. But if things continue as they are and Biden becomes our president as it seems like a forgone conclusion that he will be then people on the right and his supporters will say Biden rigged the election. While I do think the numbers for the election does seem suspicious to be honest, the reality is even if there was fraud then the problem is proving it. That's on trump to prove as all we can do as American citizens is try to survive during these harsh times regardless of who's in office. I just hope this doesn't lead to a civil war as that's the thing that worries me honestly. reply report 83 PrettyPanther posted 8 weeks ago in reply to this I live in Trump country where right wingers perpetually boast on social media about taking up arms to take back their country.

Llyod George had supported the 2nd and 3rd home rule bills, voting with Tim Healy. He introduced the rubbishy 4th home rule bill in 1920 that was rubbishy because he relied on conservative MPs to stay in power. Had we talked, and waited for a labour government, partition would not have been such a bitter event. Or so it seems to me now. Finland voted for independence in 1917 and the mandate of the Finnish Nation was respected and Finland was granted independence by the Soviet Union at the stroke of a pen in 1918. Period. Ireland voted for independence in 1918 and the mandate of the Irish Nation was rejected out of hand by Britain. Period. Spot the difference yet ?

America (North and South) North America: 1. Canada - Britain, France - mid 16th century to Confederation (1867) or the Canada Act (1982). After the Canada Act, all the constitutional control was turned over to Canada by the UK. 2. USA - Britain, France, Spain, Dutch, Germany - mid 16th century to American Independence (1776). Russians had colonized the Alaska region until the US purchased it. South America: 1. Brazil - Portuguese - roughly 300 years from 1500 to 1815. The Dutch and French also asserted their rule in Brazil for short periods. 2. Argentina - Spain - 16th century to Argentine Independence (1816). All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, …) American continent ( north) was colonized by all- USA was colonized by Italy/ German/ French/ English. Mexico, entire central America, entire South America [ except Brazil , Guyana] were colonized by Spain. Brazil was Portuguese colony, Guyana was colonized by England, France and Dutch! The Caribbean islands were colonized by England/ Spain/ Dutch. Africa All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Belgium, Germany, …) Ethiopia was technically an Italian colony between 1936 and 1941, when they were delivered by the British and recovered their monarchy. So, they are in the colony list, even if it was only 5 years. All of Africa except Ethiopia and Liberia was colonized by every European colonial power possible. 50 + nations in Africa- colonized by Portuguese/ Germany/ France/ England/ Holland/ Spain/ even by Italy for short time. ( South Africa was initially a Dutch colony). Oceania All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (do you start to see a pattern? J ) except one: Tonga Tonga was the only Pacific nation to retain its monarchical government (still in place). They became a British protectorate in 1900 but remained sovereign. Asia Almost all the countries were colonized by European, countries or japan or China, except 5 countries: China, only partially occupied by Japan during WWII and forced to sign “unequal treaty” in favor of the European during the Qing dynasty Japan, only briefly occupied by the USA after WWII Bhutan, they lost two war against Britain and had to give some territories but remained independent Nepal, they also lost a war against Britain but became after a strong ally of Britain and remained independent Thailand, the only south-Asian country to remain independent thanks to good leaders that used the rivalry between French and British to be accepted as a buffer state between both colonial power (in the process, they also lost lot of territories) 1. India - Britain, Portuguese, Dutch, French - 17th century to Indian Independence (1947). The French, the Portuguese and the Dutch held islands and major ports in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese left India in 1961. 2. Korea - Japan - Around 1910 to 1945. 3. Hong Kong - Britain - 1842 to 1997. Except for Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. 4. Burma (Myanmar) - Britain - 1824 to 1948. Whole Asia - with couple of exception- was colonized. India ( no Pakistan at that time nor Bangla Desh), Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Maldives etc. Kuwait/ UAE etc were protectorates. Giant Indonesia was under Dutch, Philippines was under Spain/ USA/ Japan. Vietnam/ Laos/ Cambodia were under France. Middle-east Again, except three countries (Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey), they were all colonized by European: Iran. The country was invaded by Britain and the soviet during WWII. The Shah was neutral but pro-axis. The problem is that with Barbarossa, the trans-Iranian railways was vital to send resources to the soviets (for the lend-lease) . Therefore, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran in 1941, put a new pro-ally Shah and kept control of the country until 1946. However, the country was just occupied and not a colony per se. Saudi Arabia. Nobody even bothered to colonize these deserts. And when the petrol was found in 1938, colonization was not trendy anymore 1. Egypt - Britain - 1882 to 1914. 2. Algeria - France - 1830 to 1962 3. Palestine - UK - 1920 to 1948 Now mostly Israel, Palestine was more of a British occupation than a colony. Europe Here, it’s sometimes a bit tricky, e.g. if you go back in time the south of Italy was a Greek colony, so Italy should be a colonized country … However, at these time the concept of country was really different, so I will only take into account modern history, when the state-nation appeared, i.e. when the concept of nation that we use appeared, so after the French revolution. I also consider a country as a colony if there is a will to “replace” the population. E.g. Lithuania was a Russian colony as Russia wanted to implant lot of Russian there. On the other hand, Belgium was not a Dutch colony, as the Dutch only wanted to annex the country. Then almost all the countries of western Europe were not colony (but most of them where conquered at some point), except Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Finland: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The three Baltic states were Russian colony, with a forced implantation of Russian people. Finland is a more dubious case. It was also a Russian colony, although they were relatively free, so they could be considered more as a protectorate. Poland, it was split between Russia, Austria and Germany and all of them wanted to implant people there. However, some other countries could be considered as colony of other. I personally don’t as in these cases, there was no will to replace the population and harvest all the resources. It was more a “usual occupation”, were one country annex the other. A good example is Belgium that was occupied by the Spanish, Austrian, French and Dutch over times but they were each time considered as part of the country and not a colony. There was no will to replace the Belgian by Spanish people or to send back all the resources to Austria. There was also a will to invest there. However, other people may disagree with me. Amongst these countries, we have: Ukraine. Again, it was conquered by Russian but I don’t know if we can consider it as a colony. The Russian only wanted to annex the “white Russian” Balkan states + Greek, it’s a total mess between the Austria and Ottoman occupation and the war between the Balkan countries. However, I don’t think that they fall under the colony status. The former states of the Austrian empire. Again, was the Czech Republic an Austrian colony. I don’t think so, but other may have another point of view Greenland, Faeroe Island, and all the island under the control of Denmark, Norway, … Again are they protectorate or colony, is mater at discussion. South Pacific: 1. Australia - Britain, Dutch - 18th century to 1901. 2. New Zealand - Britain - 1847 to self-governing (1853) or dominion (1907). Australia/ NZ/ Fiji were under UK ( even now). Pacific islands were under England/ France/ USA ( even now Samoa is under USA). - Alaska, Angola, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Congo, Ghana, Greenland, Guinea-Bissau, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Liberia, South Africa, Macau, Malta, Mozambique, Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United States of America. Which countries/regions are colonized even today Instead of ‘colonies’, these are more like autonomous territories without sovereignty Under Denmark: Faroe Islands, Greenland Under Finland: Aland Islands Under France: Saint Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Clipperton Island, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (consists: Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Mayotte) Under Netherlands: Aruba, Curacao, Sint Maarten Under Norway: Svalbard, Jan Mayen. There are some under USA and UK as well, but I can’t seem to find a proper list of them, so I’ll update the answer with them later. Palestine deserves a special mention for being colonised and under occupation by the British from 1920, and 1948 to present by Jewish settlers.

Because it's that good. And because I need an antidote to what I wrote earlier, when I was so depressed about what is happening in our country now: March 15, 1965 [As delivered in person before a joint session at 9:02 p.m.] Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress: I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy. I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause. At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man, a man of God, was killed. There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans. But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight. For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great Government--the Government of the greatest Nation on earth. Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man. In our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis. Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues; issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression. But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved Nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation. For with a country as with a person, ""What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?"" There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight as Americans--not as Democrats or Republicans-we are met here as Americans to solve that problem. This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose. The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South: ""All men are created equal""--""government by consent of the governed""--""give me liberty or give me death."" Well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories. In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives. Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man. This dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot be found in his power, or in his position. It really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others. It says that he shall share in freedom, he shall choose his leaders, educate his children, and provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being. To apply any other test--to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race, his religion or the place of his birth--is not only to do injustice, it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom. THE RIGHT TO VOTE Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy. The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders. The history of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people. Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult. But about this there can and should be no argument. Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right. Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes. Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right. The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent. And if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application. And if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test. The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test. He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of State law. And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write. For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin. Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination. No law that we now have on the books-and I have helped to put three of them there--can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it. In such a case our duty must be clear to all of us. The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color. We have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution. We must now act in obedience to that oath. GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO VOTE Wednesday I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote. The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders tomorrow. After they have reviewed it, it will come here formally as a bill. I am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and to visit with my former colleagues. I have had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which I will submit to the clerks tonight. But I want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation, This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections--Federal, State, and local--which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote. This bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution. It will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the United States Government if the State officials refuse to register them. It will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote. Finally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting. I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress--I have no doubt that I will get some--on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective. But experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the Constitution. To those who seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities; who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections, the answer is simple: Open your polling places to all your people. Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin. Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land. THE NEED FOR ACTION There is no constitutional issue here. The command of the Constitution is plain. There is no moral issue. It is wrong--deadly wrong--to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country. There is no issue of States rights or national rights. There is only the struggle for human rights. I have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer. The last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in Federal elections. That civil rights bill was passed after 8 long months of debate. And when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated. This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose. We cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in. And we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another 8 months before we get a bill. We have already waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone. So I ask you to join me in working long hours--nights and weekends, if necessary--to pass this bill. And I don't make that request lightly. For from the window where I sit with the problems of our country I recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations, and the harsh judgment of history on our acts. WE SHALL OVERCOME But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed, more than a hundred years, since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln, a great President of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed, more than a hundred years, since equality was promised. And yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise. And the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come. I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come. And when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American. For Negroes are not the only victims. How many white children have gone uneducated, how many white families have lived in stark poverty, how many white lives have been scarred by fear, because we have wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror? So I say to all of you here, and to all in the Nation tonight, that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future. This great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all: black and white, North and South, sharecropper and city dweller. These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease. They are the enemies and not our fellow man, not our neighbor. And these enemies too, poverty, disease and ignorance, we shall overcome. AN AMERICAN PROBLEM Now let none of us in any sections look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section, or on the problems of our neighbors. There is really no part of America where the promise of equality has been fully kept. In Buffalo as well as in Birmingham, in Philadelphia as well as in Selma, Americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom. This is one Nation. What happens in Selma or in Cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every American. But let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities, and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists. As we meet here in this peaceful, historic chamber tonight, men from the South, some of whom were at Iwo Jima, men from the North who have carried Old Glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it, men from the East and from the West, are all fighting together without regard to religion, or color, or region, in Viet-Nam. Men from every region fought for us across the world 20 years ago. And in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the South made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great Republic--and in some instances, a great many of them, more. And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Golden Gate to the harbors along the Atlantic, will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all Americans. For all of us owe this duty; and I believe that all of us will respond to it. Your President makes that request of every American. PROGRESS THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro. His actions and protests, his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life, have awakened the conscience of this Nation. His demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice, designed to provoke change, designed to stir reform. He has called upon us to make good the promise of America. And who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in American democracy. For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep-seated belief in the democratic process. Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but upon the force of moral right; not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order. There have been many pressures upon your President and there will be others as the days come and go. But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought: in the courts, and in the Congress, and in the hearts of men. We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly. But the right of free speech does not carry with it, as has been said, the right to holler fire in a crowded theater. We must preserve the right to free assembly, but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic. We do have a right to protest, and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors. And I intend to protect all those rights as long as I am permitted to serve in this office. We will guard against violence, knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek--progress, obedience to law, and belief in American values. In Selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace. We seek order. We seek unity. But we will not accept the peace of stifled rights, or the order imposed by fear, or the unity that stifles protest. For peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty. In Selma tonight, as in every--and we had a good day there--as in every city, we are working for just and peaceful settlement. We must all remember that after this speech I am making tonight, after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone, and after you have promptly passed this bill, the people of Selma and the other cities of the Nation must still live and work together. And when the attention of the Nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community. This cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence, as the history of the South itself shows. It is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days--last Tuesday, again today, RIGHTS MUST BE OPPORTUNITIES The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill. But, in a larger sense, most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program. Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races. Because all Americans just must have the right to vote. And we are going to give them that right. All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race. And they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race. But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right. It requires a trained mind and a healthy body. It requires a decent home, and the chance to find a job, and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty. Of course, people cannot contribute to the Nation if they are never taught to read or write, if their bodies are stunted from hunger, if their sickness goes untended, if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check. So we want to open the gates to opportunity. But we are also going to give all our people, black and white, the help that they need to walk through those gates. THE PURPOSE OF THIS GOVERNMENT My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla, Tex., in a small Mexican-American school. Few of them could speak English, and I couldn't speak much Spanish. My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast, hungry. They knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice. They never seemed to know why people disliked them. But they knew it was so, because I saw it in their eyes. I often walked home late in the afternoon, after the classes were finished, wishing there was more that I could do. But all I knew was to teach them the little that I knew, hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead. Somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child. I never thought then, in 1928, that I would be standing here in 1965. It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country. But now I do have that chance—and I'll let you in on a secret—I mean to use it. And I hope that you will use it with me. This is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe. The might of past empires is little compared to ours. But I do not want to be the President who built empires, or sought grandeur, or extended dominion. I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world. I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters. I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election. I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties. I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth. And so at the request of your beloved Speaker and the Senator from Montana; the majority leader, the Senator from Illinois; the minority leader, Mr. McCulloch, and other Members of both parties, I came here tonight--not as President Roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill, not as President Truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill--but I came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for. I want this to be the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, which did all these things for all these people. Beyond this great chamber, out yonder in 50 States, are the people that we serve. Who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen. We all can guess, from our own lives, how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness, how many problems each little family has. They look most of all to themselves for their futures. But I think that they also look to each of us. Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says--in Latin--""God has favored our undertaking."" God will not favor everything that we do. It is rather our duty to divine His will. But I cannot help believing that He truly understands and that He really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight. NOTE: The address was broadcast nationally.

Instead of targeting Republican base voters—the ones who show up for every election—he focused on the intersection of two other groups: people who knew of Donald Trump, and people who had never voted in a primary before. These were both large groups. Because of his TV career and ability to court controversy, Trump was already a household name. Meanwhile, about half America’s potential voters, nearly 100 million people, don’t vote in presidential elections, let alone primaries. The overlap between the groups was significant. If Trump could mobilize even a small percentage of those people, he could clinch the nomination, and Braynard was willing to put in the work. His strategy, built from polls, research, and studies of voting behavior, focused on two goals in particular. The first was registering, engaging, educating, and turning out non-voters, the largest electoral bloc in the country and one that’s regularly ignored. One recent survey of 12,000 “chronic non-voters” suggests they receive “little to no attention in national political conversations” and remain “a mystery to many institutions.” One way to turn out potentially sympathetic voters would be to use a call center to remind them, which would also help with his second goal: to investigate and expose voter fraud. “If you’re trying to do systematic voter fraud, you’re going to look for people who haven’t or are not going to cast their ballot,” he told me in a recent interview, “because if you do cast a ballot for them and they do show up at the polling place, that’s going to set up a red flag.” So the plan was that after the election, the call centers would contact a sample of the people in the state who had voted for the first time to confirm that they had actually cast a ballot. Not only was pursuing voter fraud popular with prospective donors, Braynard says, but it was also an endeavor supported by the academic literature. “I believe it’s been documented, at least scientifically in some peer-reviewed studies, that at least one senator in the last 10 years was elected by votes that aren’t legal ballots,” he says. This single voter fraud study has become canonical among conservative, and many of today’s other claims of fraud—such as through mail-in voting—also trace back to it. A study like this does in fact exist, and it and is peer-reviewed. In fact, it goes even further than Braynard remembers. Published in 2014 by Jesse Richman, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, it argues that illegal votes have played a major role in recent political outcomes. In 2008, Richman argued, “non-citizen votes” for Senate candidate Al Franken “likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform.” The paper has become canonical among conservatives. Whenever you hear that 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote, this is where it came from. Many of today’s other claims of voter fraud—such as through mail-in voting—also trace back to this study. And it’s easy to see why it has taken root on the right: higher turnout in elections generally increases the number of Democratic voters, and so proof of massive voter fraud justifies voting restrictions that disproportionately affect them. Academic research on voting behavior is often narrowly focused and heavily qualified, so Richman’s claim offered something exceedingly rare: near certainty that fraud was happening at a significant rate. According to his study, at least 38,000 ineligible voters—and perhaps as many as 2.8 million—cast ballots in the 2008 election, meaning the “blue wave” that put Obama in office and expanded the Democrats’ control over Congress would have been built on sand. For those who were fed up with margins of error, confidence intervals, and gray areas, Richman’s numbers were refreshing. They were also very wrong. The data dilemma If you want to study how, whether, and for whom people are going to vote, the first thing you need is voters to ask. Want to reach them by phone? Good luck calling landlines: very few people pick up. You might have a better chance with cell phones, but don’t expect much. Telephone surveys are “barge in” research says Jay H. Leve, the CEO of SurveyUSA, a polling firm based in New Jersey. These phone polls, he says, happen at a time that’s convenient to the pollster, and “to hell with the respondent.” For that reason, the company aims to limit calls to four to six minutes, “before the respondent begins to feel like he or she is being abused.” Online surveys are preferable because respondents can complete them when they want, but it’s still hard to motivate people. For that reason, many survey companies offer something in return for people’s opinion, typically points that can be exchanged for gift cards. Even if you’ve found participants, you want to make sure you’re asking good questions, says Stephen Ansolabehere, a government professor at Harvard. He is principal investigator of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), a national survey of more than 50,000 people about demographics, general political attitudes, and voting intentions—and the data set used in Jesse Richman’s voter fraud study. It’s easy to generate bias in your results by wording your survey questions poorly, says Ansolabehere. Pollsters got it wrong in the 2016 election. Now they want another shot. “We’ll try and be literal and give brief descriptions, and we generally don’t do things too adjectivally,” Ansolabehere says. But what about when the bill you’re asking about is called something inflammatory, like the “Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act?” “We don’t use that title,” he says. Another problem with opinion polling is that what somebody thinks doesn’t really matter if it’s not going to translate into a vote. That means you have to figure out who will actually show up to the polls. Here, demographic data is helpful. Women vote slightly more than men. White people vote more than people of color. Those 65 and older vote at rates roughly 50% higher than those 18 to 29, and advanced degree holders up to nearly three times as often as those without a high school diploma. However, even if you ladle on the enticements, some demographic groups are simply less likely to respond to survey requests, which means you’ll need to adjust the numbers coming out of your survey group. Most polling firms do this by amplifying the responses they get from underrepresented groups: a survey with a small sample of Hispanic voters, say, might weight their responses more heavily if trying to predict behavior in a battleground state like Arizona, where 24% of voters are Latino. One 2016 presidential poll conducted included a young Black man living in the Midwest who supported Trump. Because he represented several harder-to-reach categories—young, minority, male—his responses were dramatically over-indexed. But beware: this weighting can backfire. One 2016 presidential poll conducted by the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Times recruited 3,000 respondents from across America, including a young Black man living in the Midwest who turned out to be a Trump supporter. Because he represented several harder-to-reach categories—young, minority, male—his responses were dramatically over-indexed. This ended up throwing the numbers off: at one point the survey estimated Trump’s support among Black voters at 20%, largely on the basis of this one man’s responses. A post-election analysis put that number at 6%. The media, grasping for certainty, missed the error margins of the study and reached for the headline figures that amplified these overweighted responses. As a result, the survey team— which had already made raw data, weighting schemes, and methodology public—stopped releasing sub-samples of their data to prevent their study being distorted again. Not all researchers are as concerned about potential misinterpretation of their work, however. An academic controversy Until Richman’s 2014 paper, the virtual consensus among academics was that non-citizen voting didn’t exist on any functional level. Then he and his coauthors examined CCES data and claimed that such voters could actually number several million. Richman asserted that the illegal votes of non-citizens had changed not only the pivotal 60th Senate vote but also the race for the White House. “It is likely though by no means certain that John McCain would have won North Carolina were it not for the votes for Obama cast by non-citizens,” the paper says. After its publication, Richman then wrote an article for the Washington Post with a similarly provocative headline that focused on the upcoming 2014 midterms: “Could non-citizens decide the November election?” Unsurprisingly, conservatives ran with this new support for their old narrative and have continued to do so. The study’s fans include President Trump, who used it to justify the creation of his short-lived and failed commission on voter fraud, and whose claims about illegal voting are now a centerpiece of his campaign. But most other academics saw the study as an example of methodological failure. Ansolabehere, whose CCES data Richman relied on, coauthored a response to Richman’s work titled “The Perils of Cherry Picking Low-Frequency Events in Large Sample Sizes.” AP PHOTO/TALLAHASSEE DEMOCRAT, BILL COTTERELL, POOL Stephen Ansolabehere. For starters, he argued, the paper overweighted the non-citizens in the survey—just as the Black Midwestern voter was overweighted to produce an illusion of widespread Black support for Trump. This was especially problematic in Richman’s study, wrote Ansolabehere, when you consider the impact that a tiny number of people who were misclassified as non-citizens would have on the data. Some people, said Ansolabehere, had likely misidentified themselves as ineligible to vote in the 2008 study by mistake—perhaps out of sloppiness, misunderstanding, or just the rush to accumulate points for gift cards. Critically, nobody who had claimed to be a non-citizen in both the 2010 survey and the follow-up in 2012 had cast a validated vote. Nearly 200 social scientists echoed Ansolabehere’s concerns in an open letter, but for Harold Clarke, then editor of the journal that published Richman’s paper, the blowback was hypocritical. “If we were to condemn all the papers on voting behavior that have made claims about political participation based on survey data,” he says, “well, this paper is identical. There’s no difference whatsoever.” As it turns out, survey data does contain a lot of errors—not least because many people who say they voted are lying. In 2012, Ansolabehere and a colleague discovered that huge numbers of Americans were misreporting their voting activity. But it wasn’t the non-citizens,",unknown,"#ifttt, #ifttt network",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,USA,0,,,,http://shoukhinvlog.tumblr.com/post/633635294923685889,,,ca228b880befa6717db8046d98750d43,,FALSE,,,,,post,0,,290801000,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:38.583+0000,,,shoukhinvlog,,,tumblr,Tumblr,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Tumblr,,,TUMBLR_TEXT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,507014151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its Dividend Looks Safe. | Barron's (10/29/20, subscription publication) ++++++ Portfolio Management: There continues to be a continuous stream of early corporate bond redemptions. Those early redemptions fall into two general categories. (1) Some issuers are redeeming in the short period just prior to maturity date when they are allowed to do so without having to pay a make whole payment. Usually that period is 1 month prior to maturity, but some issuers have sufficient bargaining power to extend the period to 2 or even 3 months. The bargaining power for a longer period in some instances may go beyond the credit quality issue and include the acceptance of a higher than normal coupon for the credit rating. A recent example is Lockheed Martin's redemption one month early of a 2.5% SU note: (2) The other category involves required make whole payments to exercise the optional redemption rights. A recent example is this 3.7% Corporate Office Properties note that would have matured on 6/15/21, where the issuer had to pay a 2.18% premium to the $1K par value: COPT Announces Expiration of Tender Offer for 3.700% Senior Notes due 2021 and Delivery of Notice of Redemption for Remaining 3.700% Senior Notes due 2021 | Corporate Office Properties Trust Item # 3.A. Bought 2 OFC 3.7% SU Notes Maturing on 6/15/21 (5/10/18 Post) In both categories, the issuer has to pay accrued interest. I received a $25.29 interest payment with the principal payment of $2,043.61 for the two $1k par value bonds. The prospectus for the Corporate Office Properties note would have allowed an early redemption without a make whole payment within two months prior to maturity Pages S11-12 Even though the time to maturity is short, only about 8 months, the make whole payment is juiced by the size of the coupon and the extremely low treasury rate + 25 basis points used to discount the remaining interest due and the principle amount to present value. The low discount rate in effect adds almost all of the remaining interest to the principal amount that has to be paid when exercising the early redemption right. I still own a Corporate Office Property L.P. 3.6% SU maturing on 5/15/23. FINRA Bond Detail (currently rated Baa3/BBB-); Item # 1.E. Bought 2 OFC 3.6% SU bonds maturing in 2023 at a TC of 98.264 (4/23/17 Post)(YTM then at 3.922%) For a new purchaser of that bond, and based on recent transactions, the YTM would be about 1.1%. The problem with the early redemptions is that they are lessening the usefulness of my bond ladder and providing me with even more proceeds that are landing in my broker sweep accounts paying .01% on top of regularly scheduled redemptions, interest and dividend payments. I have managed to stabilize over the past few weeks the cash allocations as percentage of each brokerage accounts total value. That is primarily due to net purchases, a rise in risk asset prices and a slowdown in the total value of bond redemptions from the levels experienced between January and August 2020. Electric Utility Stocks: I like most utility stocks less now than when I started to buy. Valuations are high and yields are relatively paltry. I have started to pare my small ball positions in EVRG, DUK, and PEG, as discussed below. I have not pared PPL which is owned in multiple accounts with unrealized profits in 2 ROTH IRA accounts and 2 taxable accounts and an unrealized loss in my largest position bought first. Part of the paring has to do with comparative dividend yields and partly to valuations after price spurts in EVRG, DUK and PEG. I am unable to generate any excitement in owning those stocks and will not be buying more shares at current prices. DUK is my second largest electric utility position. I am playing small ball with that one, selling near $90 or higher and buying near $80 or lower. I did recently start a position in NJR, a natural gas utility, which I will discuss in a few weeks. New Jersey Resources Corp. (NJR) The NJR yield was somewhat better than the EVRG or PEG. Currently Owned Electric Utility Stocks-All Small Ball Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) Evergy Inc. (EVRG) Exelon Corp. (EXC) PPL Corp. (PPL) Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) I currently have 1 share Placeholder positions in two electric utility stocks: Southern Company (SO); Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED) American Electric Power Company (AEP). I sold out of Dominion Energy (D) after the company announced a substantial dividend slash. The consensus E.P.S. estimate for PEG is for $3.4 this year and in 2021. The consensus E.P.S. estimate for EVRG is for $3.2 this year and $3.25 next year. While I am not buying any $1K par value bonds traded in the bond market, I have been nibbling on a few exchange traded bonds and equity preferred stocks ($25 par values). I discuss the purchase of CCNEP, an equity preferred stock in Item # 2 below and adds to the exchange traded bond HTFA in Item # 4 below. More Emphasis on Dividend Income: Interest income is in a dive mode as fixed income securities mature or are redeemed early. Tennessee municipal bond interest payments have eclipsed corporate bond interest payments. The following snapshots are from my Fidelity account: Over the past several months, I have started to rely on new purchases of dividend paying stocks and CEFs for income generation. ++++ Trump: I am slowly plowing through the audio version of Woodward's book ""Rage"", which is Donald's normal state of being. I can only tolerate a few minutes when Woodward is quoting from a tape of an interview. I just finished listening to the part where Donald said everyone involved in the Russian investigation was guilty of treason and needed to be sentenced to 50 years in prison so they would all die there. Donald Trump Wants 'Anonymous' Author Miles Taylor to Be Prosecuted Hopefully, we will know when I publish my next post whether Donald will be given another 4 years as President. It is certainly possible that voters will give this lying, malevolent, ignorant, demagogic malignant narcissist with dominant authoritarian tendencies another 4 years as President. He is obviously unfit to be President. About 78% of white evangelical christians support Donald: White Christians still favor Trump over Biden, but support has slipped | Pew Research Center They admire his honesty and good character. Donald is the kind of decent christian man that their children can aspire to emulate as a role model. And, Donald keeps the bible on his nightstand and reads one of his favorite passages before tweeting. When pressed some will say they approve of the ""conservative"" justices that Trump has appointed, meaning justices that will overrule Roe v. Wade. That justification is no longer going to fly since the Supreme Court already has a relatively youthful reactionary majority, packed with 5 deeply reactionary Justices and one that floats back and forth from reactionary to conservative. Roe v. Wade is toast. If he loses, hopefully Demagogue Don will be totally ignored by a majority of Americans thereafter and will be view as nothing more than a source of brain pollution. I will certainly ignore him but ignoring him will not remove the permanent stain on the U.S. that he has left.

Mike Pence will not quarantine after four aides test positive for Covid-19 At least 5 people in Pence's orbit, including chief of staff Marc Short, are positive for coronavirus One of the aides is Marc Short who is Pence's Chief-of-Staff who is in quarantine. Pence regards his continued campaigning as being necessary as an ""essential"" worker under CDC guidelines. Mark Meadows: ""We're not going to control the pandemic"". ‘We’re not going to control the pandemic’: White House chief’s comments undermine Trump’s message - POLITICO This is yet another of a long list of messages sent by Trump and other republicans that mask wearing does not control the pandemic. Meadows may me right that there is no control in states where republicans refuse to wear masks and attend congregate gatherings without socially distancing. In North Dakota, the republican governor Doug Burgam repurposed $16M of unused CAREs Act funds to the fracking industry, even though hospitals beds are already full in many areas with rural hospitals transferring patients out-of-state. Mask wearing has not been mandated by Burgam, even though infections are surging and hospitals are near capacity before the start of flu season. Wearing masks in that republican state is the exception.

If they want to be dumb enough to walk around and expose themselves and others, that's fine with me. Nobody's wearing the damned mask anyway... I'm sitting back and watching them catch it and die. Hopefully I'll live through it."" Allen Banks voting member: ""Something's making these people sick, and I'm pretty sure that it's not coronavirus, so the question that you should be asking is, 'What's making them sick?"" Idaho is controlled by republicans and will heavily vote to give Don the Authoritarian 4 more years as President.

The preceding numbers do not reflect cash available for distribution (CAD) which IMO is the most relevant cash flow calculation. The CAD calculation subtracts certain actual cash expenses from the AFFO number (cash used for tenant improvements, routine capital expenditures; leasing related expenses and acquisition costs). Cash used to pay those expenses are not available for distribution to the shareholders. I have to calculate the CAD per share numbers by dividing the CAD dollar amount by the outstanding diluted shares using the date provided by DEA.

Annual numbers do fluctuate up and down depending on the dollar adjustments to the AFFO and CAD calculations. Last Earnings Report (6/30/20): SEC Filed Press Release The third quarter report is scheduled for release on 11/2/20.

Yield Before Taxes at AC = 8.34%. The yield before taxes will depend on the CAD/USD conversion rate when each payment is converted into USDs. To make a rough calculation, I assumed that the CAD/USD exchange rate will remain constant, which will not happen of course, at .75 which gives me US$2.43 per share. If the CAD/USD exchange rate was at 1 for an entire year, the yield before taxes would increase to 11.12% with no change in the dividend rate. If the CAD/USD was at .65 for an entire year, the yield would decrease to 7.23% with no change in the dividend rate. Dividend Reinvestment: I am not reinvesting the dividend in this account.

Dividend Stopper Clause: Yes (see bottom of page S-8 and top of S-9) This clause enforces the preferred shareholder's superior claim to cash compared only to the common shareholder. An elimination of the preferred stock dividend can only occur when the company first eliminates its cash common share dividend and thereafter avoids using cash to buyback its common stock. For a non-cumulative preferred stock, the owners have no right to ever receive the omitted dividend payments. Once the common and preferred share cash dividends are eliminated, the preferred shareholders only right is to start receiving dividends again when and if the company restores any common stock cash dividend. The norm is for bank holding companies to issue non-cumulative preferred stocks, while REITs (equity and MREITs) and many other companies issue cumulative preferred stock.

Moved back to Canada in January of '17. Can't go wrong with an all in one etf for equities in VEQT Vanguard All-Equity ETF Portfolio. I have it through RBC. Probably too heavy in Canadian equities, but it's not like Canadian banks are struggling with all the fees they charge me for both my Canadian and American accounts! Vanguard has balanced ETFs, too but I was looking for 100 percent equities to balance out my other US and Canadian retirement accounts. I love Vanguard for its simplicity. You'll find what you're looking for, and the hardest part will be deciding the ratios you're comfortable with investing. Good luck! Canadian banks are highly leveraged to the housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. They are structured, with the CMHC, that they won't take the pain of widespread defaults, at least not at first. Non-traditional lenders & CMHC & Genworth (backstopped by the taxpayer) will take that pain. But if you read Hillard Macbeth's book on the housing bubble, and track his twitter, I think there's a persuasive case there that the Canadian banks won't be able to avoid the hit to earnings, and therefore to dividends and share prices, if Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto go south. In Toronto, at least, that condo market looks very bubblish to me.* On most measures of valuation, personal debt to GDP etc Canada now looks worse than USA 2006 If it is part of a diversified portfolio I agree that it's not the end of the world. And TD Bank and Scotiabank (and BMO via Harris Bank) all have substantial non-Canadian operations. But I do think Canadians need to keep a high level of international diversification. I am totally sold though on the merits of a Vanguard ""one decision fund"" that you just keep buying. The time to buy stocks is when all is doom and gloom, and the time to sell is when all is sunny skies. The opposite of what we do as human beings, mostly. Thus, having the discipline of one fund that you keep contributing to is golden (and as long as it's not more than 30% Canadian equities, I would accept that risk concentration). * check back on this Forum. I have been calling a Toronto housing bubble for at least 5 years, if not nearly 10. Living through the -40% in the early 90s probably scarred me for life. Hah this is a great point! I thought though since the 2008 crash that new guidelines and allocation laws/practices were brought in? Housing prices in Canada, AFAIK, did not crash in 2008. The Minister of Finance at the time (Floyd? the one who died?) loosened CMHC requirements to stimulate the housing market. Housing prices (GVA & GTA at least) dipped for a few months then went straight back up. Toronto currently has more tall construction cranes than any 2 other North American cities combined (including New York, I believe). There was a retightening of CMHC rules subsequently. But if you analyse what's happened, you see prices (GVA and GTA) moving to among the highest price/ income and price/ rent of any big cities in the world. And whereas Americans rebuilt their savings post 2008, Canadians kept right on borrowing - highest private sector debt to GDP in the country's history, and higher than USA in 2006 at peak of its bubble. Maybe Canada won't crash. I know Mark Carney was worried about it when he was governor of Bank of Canada. Maybe mortgage rules were tightened soon enough. But my argument is if you are a Canadian, your currency is driven by 2 (or 3) main factors: - what the US economy is doing. US gets a cold, Canada gets the flu. This was not true in the 2008-10 recession because Canadian consumer kept on spending - what natural resource prices are doing. Particularly oil. Canada's biggest exports (other than autos & parts) are raw materials and the market tends to drive the currency up when natural resource prices are high, and down when they are low (relative to the informal ""base line"" against the USD that the Bank of Canada seems to track). For Australia it is probably iron ore, steam coal; for Canada it is Western Canada Syncrude (plus possibly various wood products) - (now) the state of the Canadian economy, which is about the housing market & consumer spending & business confidence. And more than half of all residential property by value (let alone commercial) is probably in GTA & GVA (I would guess more like 2/3rds). It's easy to sketch out scenarios where fiscal problems (what if Newfoundland goes bust? What's that going to do to Canada's credit rating?) or a housing bubble bust or a prolongued global recession (Chinese demand not driving up raw materials prices) makes Canada's economy very weak. The only remaining tool available to government, then, will be to devalue the dollar (as was done in the 1990s) and rebalance the economy towards exports to the USA (but not of dairy products ). For a Canadian investor, that speaks to global diversification. What you don't want is to get caught in that steamroller if it goes against you. The other main issue is the absence of technology stocks in the Canadian market. Gone are the days when Nortel was 25% of the TSX (and of course that was a horrendous bubble). Canada's index is heavily concentrated in its banks, other financials, natural resources (especially oil sands). Dig out a TSX ETF and see what the top 20 holdings are. From memory, $100k in that ETF is something like $7600 in one bank (Googled it - Royal Bank of Canada). Shopify also looks like a bubble to me. A company whose PE is inflated because it is the only representative Canadian stock in the consumer-internet space. But, then, I remember the days of Nortel and JSDU Uniphase ...

Semiconductor designer AMD said it would buy Xilinx in a $35 billion all-stock deal, intensifying its battle with Intel in the data center chip market. The deal, which AMD expects to close at the end of 2021, would create a combined firm with 13,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Under the deal, Xilinx shareholders will receive about 1.7 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, valuing Xilinx at $143 per share, or about 24.8% higher than its $114.55 closing price on Oct. 26. AMD shareholders will own about 74% of the combined firm, with Xilinx shareholders owning the remaining 26%. The companies said the transaction was intended to be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. AMD's Lisa Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx's Victor Peng serving as president responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives. The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings. AMD also reported earnings earlier than scheduled. It reported revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.80 billion and 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.57 billion and 36 cents per share. • J M Smucker (SJM) & B&G Foods (BGS). J M Smucker will sell its Crisco business to peer B&G Foods in an all-cash deal valued at about $550 million, as it focuses on pet food, coffee and snacks, the companies said on Monday. J M Smucker, which is looking to exit the U.S. baking category, said the deal also includes its oils and shortening business outside the United States. The company, known for its jelly and beverages, expects the divestiture to cut its annual adjusted earnings per share by 45 cents to 55 cents. Moves • American International Group Inc (AIG). The insurer on Monday said its board approved a plan to separate the life and retirement business from the rest of the company, and named President Peter Zaffino as chief executive officer, effective next year. The insurer said it has yet to make a decision on how to carry out the separation, beyond the board voting to establish two independent, market-leading companies. The separation of the business could take ""a couple of years"" and may be done in phases through sales of minority stakes, according to two people familiar with the matter. The board's decision does not rule out a single sale and any proposed transactions will also need board approval, AIG said. AIG also on Monday said that it incurred an estimated $790 million in catastrophe losses during the third quarter, net of reinsurance and before tax, including $185 million of estimated catastrophe losses for claims related to COVID-19. The losses were broadly in line with what analysts expected. • Tapestry Inc (TPR). The company said its interim chief executive officer Joanne Crevoiserat would take over the role on a permanent basis. Crevoiserat was serving as the company's chief financial officer until July, before replacing Jide Zeitlin who stepped down as CEO amid an investigation into his personal behavior. Crevoiserat is also expected to be appointed to Tapestry's board, the company said. In Other News • Alibaba Group Holding (BABA). Ant Group will close institutional order books of the Hong Kong portion of its record-setting dual IPO ahead of schedule due to strong demand, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The institutional book of the $17.2 billion Hong Kong listing was due to close on Thursday, but that deadline will be accelerated to Wednesday 5.00 p.m. in each region, three sources said. The book was oversubscribed just one hour after the launch on Monday, two separate sources said. The company, which is an affiliate of Alibaba, is looking to raise up to $34.4 billion in Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the offer split between the two cities, giving it a valuation of about $312 billion. ""The demand is overwhelming ... It will smash all previous records,"" Francis Lun, Hong Kong-based chief executive of GEO Securities, said about retail demand for Ant. • Alphabet Inc (GOOGL). U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Monday set a status hearing on the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google for Friday. The Justice Department last week sued the $1 trillion company and accused it of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades. Mehta said lawyers for Google and the Justice Department must appear at the telephone status hearing at 10 a.m. EDT that will be open to the public or media. • AstraZeneca PLC (AZN). South Korea's food and drug ministry said it had begun a preliminary review of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca for potential fast-track approval. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in a statement that it had formed a screening team to review the vaccine candidate, with an application for formal approval expected in 90 days under its rapid approval programme for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. The team is reviewing the vaccine's non-clinical test data, the ministry said. • Boeing Co (BA).

""We deplore Beijing’s efforts to retaliate against U.S. and foreign companies for their sales that support Taiwan’s legitimate self-defense requirements,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. Monday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department covered the proposed sale of up to 100 Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems (HCDS), which includes 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Surface Launched Missiles to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles. • Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW). The company said on Monday it is laying off about 1,000 positions in the combined workforce of Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade to streamline and reshape their branch network. ""These reductions are part of our efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms,"" Charles Schwab, which completed the acquisition of TD Ameritrade earlier in October, said. The financial services company also said it won't be executing any additional company-wide reductions for the rest of 2020. ""Employees whose roles are impacted by today's changes will have early access to all newly opened positions and be treated as internal candidates for the more than 1,000 currently open positions at Schwab through their 60-day notice period"", the company said on Monday. • Citigroup Inc (C). Ireland's permanent tsb (PTSB) announced the sale of a portfolio of 3,700 buy-to-let mortgage accounts for a consideration of 1.2 billion euros to a subsidiary of U.S. bank Citibank. The sale of the loans, which are predominately on interest-only repayment terms, are classified as performing and have an average remaining term of 10 years, PTSB said in a statement. Citibank, which is making the purchase via Citibank NA London, intends to syndicate the portfolio via securitisation following completion of the acquisition, the PTSB statement said. • dMY Technology Group Inc II (DMYD). Genius Sports Group said it would go public through a merger with New York-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group, valuing it at about $1.5 billion, including debt. The boards of both the companies have unanimously approved the transaction, the company said in a statement. The new company is expected to trade its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""GENI"", upon closing of the deal, the company said. • Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). The bank attempted to cover up allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by the company's global head of litigation, a lawsuit filed on Monday in New York State Supreme Court claimed. The lawsuit was filed by Marla Crawford, a former associate general counsel at the bank, against Goldman Sachs, the bank's General Counsel Karen Seymour and its Global Head of Litigation, Darrell Cafasso. The lawsuit claimed Cafasso used his position of power to ""romantically prey upon a much younger and vulnerable female colleague."" Crawford, who was a confidant of the alleged victim, attempted to speak up about the alleged misconduct, the lawsuit said, and was subsequently fired after 10 years of ""exemplary performance."" • Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS). The casino operator is exploring a sale of its flagship casinos in Las Vegas for about $6 billion, a source told Reuters on Monday, with the move likely to mark the exit of the group's chairman from the U.S. gambling industry for now. The properties included in the potential sale are Sands Expo Convention Center, the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Palazzo, the source added, asking not to be identified. Bloomberg reported earlier that Las Vegas Sands is working with an adviser to solicit interest from potential suitors, with a company representative cited by the news outlet confirming there were early discussions about a sale and that nothing has been finalised. • Tiffany & Co (TIF). The jeweler has received all regulatory approvals needed for the completion of its $16 billion acquisition by French luxury goods group LVMH, Tiffany said on Monday after it received a nod from the European Commission. The approval from the European competition authorities comes amid a legal battle between LVMH and Tiffany, with the latter suing the Louis Vuitton owner in a Delaware court, alleging that the French company has deliberately been stalling the completion of the deal. • Twitter Inc (TWTR). The social media company on Monday flagged a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump about mail-in ballots, adding a disclaimer describing the post's content as ""disputed"" and potentially misleading. ""Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd"", Trump tweeted late on Monday, with the tweet giving no evidence for his assertion. ""Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about how to participate in an election or another civic process"", Twitter's disclaimer said. The disclaimer included a link to a page highlighting how mail voting was legal and safe.

Canada - Britain, France - mid 16th century to Confederation (1867) or the Canada Act (1982). After the Canada Act, all the constitutional control was turned over to Canada by the UK. 2. USA - Britain, France, Spain, Dutch, Germany - mid 16th century to American Independence (1776). Russians had colonized the Alaska region until the US purchased it. South America: 1. Brazil - Portuguese - roughly 300 years from 1500 to 1815. The Dutch and French also asserted their rule in Brazil for short periods. 2. Argentina - Spain - 16th century to Argentine Independence (1816). All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, …) American continent ( north) was colonized by all- USA was colonized by Italy/ German/ French/ English. Mexico, entire central America, entire South America [ except Brazil , Guyana] were colonized by Spain. Brazil was Portuguese colony, Guyana was colonized by England, France and Dutch! The Caribbean islands were colonized by England/ Spain/ Dutch. Africa All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Belgium, Germany, …) Ethiopia was technically an Italian colony between 1936 and 1941, when they were delivered by the British and recovered their monarchy. So, they are in the colony list, even if it was only 5 years. All of Africa except Ethiopia and Liberia was colonized by every European colonial power possible. 50 + nations in Africa- colonized by Portuguese/ Germany/ France/ England/ Holland/ Spain/ even by Italy for short time. ( South Africa was initially a Dutch colony). Oceania All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (do you start to see a pattern? J ) except one: Tonga Tonga was the only Pacific nation to retain its monarchical government (still in place). They became a British protectorate in 1900 but remained sovereign. Asia Almost all the countries were colonized by European, countries or japan or China, except 5 countries: China, only partially occupied by Japan during WWII and forced to sign “unequal treaty” in favor of the European during the Qing dynasty Japan, only briefly occupied by the USA after WWII Bhutan, they lost two war against Britain and had to give some territories but remained independent Nepal, they also lost a war against Britain but became after a strong ally of Britain and remained independent Thailand, the only south-Asian country to remain independent thanks to good leaders that used the rivalry between French and British to be accepted as a buffer state between both colonial power (in the process, they also lost lot of territories) 1. India - Britain, Portuguese, Dutch, French - 17th century to Indian Independence (1947). The French, the Portuguese and the Dutch held islands and major ports in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese left India in 1961. 2. Korea - Japan - Around 1910 to 1945. 3. Hong Kong - Britain - 1842 to 1997. Except for Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. 4. Burma (Myanmar) - Britain - 1824 to 1948. Whole Asia - with couple of exception- was colonized. India ( no Pakistan at that time nor Bangla Desh), Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Maldives etc. Kuwait/ UAE etc were protectorates. Giant Indonesia was under Dutch, Philippines was under Spain/ USA/ Japan. Vietnam/ Laos/ Cambodia were under France. Middle-east Again, except three countries (Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey), they were all colonized by European/Ottoman: Iran. The country was invaded by Britain and the soviet during WWII. The Shah was neutral but pro-axis. The problem is that with Barbarossa, the trans-Iranian railways was vital to send resources to the soviets (for the lend-lease) . Therefore, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran in 1941, put a new pro-ally Shah and kept control of the country until 1946. However, the country was just occupied and not a colony per se. Saudi Arabia. Nobody even bothered to colonize these deserts. And when the petrol was found in 1938, colonization was not trendy anymore -T urkey 1. Egypt - Britain - 1882 to 1914. 2. Algeria - France - 1830 to 1962 3. Palestine - UK - 1920 to 1948 Now mostly Israel, Palestine was more of a British occupation than a colony. Europe Here, it’s sometimes a bit tricky, e.g. if you go back in time the south of Italy was a Greek colony, so Italy should be a colonized country … However, at these time the concept of country was really different, so I will only take into account modern history, when the state-nation appeared, i.e. when the concept of nation that we use appeared, so after the French revolution. I also consider a country as a colony if there is a will to “replace” the population. E.g. Lithuania was a Russian colony as Russia wanted to implant lot of Russian there. On the other hand, Belgium was not a Dutch colony, as the Dutch only wanted to annex the country. Then almost all the countries of western Europe were not colony (but most of them where conquered at some point), except Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Finland: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The three Baltic states were Russian colony, with a forced implantation of Russian people. Finland is a more dubious case. It was also a Russian colony, although they were relatively free, so they could be considered more as a protectorate. Poland, it was split between Russia, Austria and Germany and all of them wanted to implant people there. However, some other countries could be considered as colony of other. I personally don’t as in these cases, there was no will to replace the population and harvest all the resources. It was more a “usual occupation”, were one country annex the other. A good example is Belgium that was occupied by the Spanish, Austrian, French and Dutch over times but they were each time considered as part of the country and not a colony. There was no will to replace the Belgian by Spanish people or to send back all the resources to Austria. There was also a will to invest there. However, other people may disagree with me. Amongst these countries, we have: Ukraine. Again, it was conquered by Russian but I don’t know if we can consider it as a colony. The Russian only wanted to annex the “white Russian” Balkan states + Greek, it’s a total mess between the Austria and Ottoman occupation and the war between the Balkan countries. However, I don’t think that they fall under the colony status. The former states of the Austrian empire. Again, was the Czech Republic an Austrian colony. I don’t think so, but other may have another point of view Greenland, Faeroe Island, and all the island under the control of Denmark, Norway, … Again are they protectorate or colony, is mater at discussion. South Pacific: 1. Australia - Britain, Dutch - 18th century to 1901. 2. New Zealand - Britain - 1847 to self-governing (1853) or dominion (1907). Australia/ NZ/ Fiji were under UK ( even now). Pacific islands were under England/ France/ USA ( even now Samoa is under USA). - Alaska, Angola, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Congo, Ghana, Greenland, Guinea-Bissau, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Liberia, South Africa, Macau, Malta, Mozambique, Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United States of America. Which countries/regions are colonized even today Instead of ‘colonies’, these are more like autonomous territories without sovereignty Under Denmark: Faroe Islands, Greenland Under Finland: Aland Islands Under France: Saint Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Clipperton Island, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (consists: Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Mayotte) Under Netherlands: Aruba, Curacao, Sint Maarten Under Norway: Svalbard, Jan Mayen. There are some under USA and UK as well, but I can’t seem to find a proper list of them, so I’ll update the answer with them later. Palestine deserves a special mention for being colonised and under occupation by the British from 1920, and 1948 to present by Jewish settlers. While other nations allow the colonized population equal/voting rights to vote, Israel doesn’t have the population to support such an approach and, therefore, prolongs the occupation/apartheid indefinitely to ensure Jewish majority in government in apartheid democracy.",male,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLqZVtxRqiMlc=Ugz7LlRE0smpXAPFHTF4AaABAg&lc=Ugz7LlRE0smpXAPFHTF4AaABAg,,,f03e2eef942e9e0adeac0ca958ef1df8,,FALSE,,,,,reply,0,,1E+11,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:23.637+0000,,,,,,youtube,YouTube,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,YouTube,,,VCOMMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vlad Igor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By Jamelle Bouie Opinion Columnist Oct. 23, 2020 It is not actually clear that new states are on the agenda should Democrats win in November. House Democrats have passed a bill to admit the District of Columbia as a state, and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nydia Velázquez of New York have introduced a bill to let Puerto Ricans hold a binding referendum on their future, but Senate Democrats are still somewhat silent on the issue. Nonetheless, congressional Republicans have raised the specter of new states as they fight to defend their majority in the Senate. In June, after the House passed its D.C. statehood bill, Senate Republicans went on a tear against the measure, with Lindsey Graham of South Carolina condemning it as an unconstitutional power grab that would “empower the most radical agenda in modern American politics.” Later, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, used his time at the Republican National Convention to warn of dire consequences should the District become a state. They want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want free health care for illegal immigrants, yet they offer no protection at all for unborn Americans. They want to pack the Supreme Court with liberals intent on eroding our constitutional rights. And they want to codify all this by making the swamp itself, Washington, D.C., America’s 51st state. With two more liberal senators, we cannot undo the damage they’ve done. More recently, on Fox News, Graham — fighting an unusually tough battle for re-election against his Democratic challenger, Jaime Harrison — warned of a “parade of horribles” should Republicans lose the Senate and the White House. “If they win, it is not going to be about a health care debate,” he said, referring to the last period of unified Democratic control in 2009, “they are going to structurally change the country to make it harder for a Republican to get elected president. They are going to make D.C. a state, altering the balance of power in the Senate.” On Twitter, likewise, Senator John Cornyn of Texas — also in a competitive race for re-election against the Democratic challenger MJ Hegar — warned that a Democratic majority in Congress would make D.C. and Puerto Rico states, adding four additional members to the Senate. This would also, he said, mean “nine new members of the Electoral College, equivalent of New Mexico and New Hampshire combined.” Presumably, these states would also vote Democratic in the next presidential election. Here, it’s worth taking a small step back. Whatever the political and constitutional challenges, the case for D.C. statehood is straightforward: American citizens deserve full representation in Congress. Similarly, the people of Puerto Rico deserve the right to chose their own future. If they decide to remain within the American union, they too deserve full representation. The same goes for everyone under the dominion of the United States: They should be able to choose either independence or representation. It is true that at this moment D.C. statehood benefits the Democratic Party; Puerto Rico, on the other hand, has routinely chosen Republicans for statewide office. Regardless, there’s no reason to think that in the long run the Republican Party would not be able to compete for votes in either D.C. or Puerto Rico, and yet Republicans believe they are disadvantaged by new states and additional voters. This is true beyond the politics of statehood. It is well known, at this point, that as a general rule Republicans are more likely to restrict voters than to encourage them. Across the country, Republican lawmakers and officials have erected new obstacles to voting, from strict voter identification laws (passed immediately in the wake of Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court ruling that killed a key piece of the Voting Rights Act) to poll closures, limits on voter registration and, most recently, new restrictions on mail-in voting. Just this week, the conservative Supreme Court majority sided with Alabama election officials against curbside voting for voters with disabilities, as well as those vulnerable to Covid-19. There’s more. Republicans in Wisconsin, for example, have gerrymandered the state so that nothing short of a Democratic supermajority could break their hold on the State Legislature. And the Trump administration, seeking to enhance the power and influence of its white, rural base, has undermined the census, aiming for an undercount that would deprive millions of Americans in cities and other more diverse areas of federal resources and representation. In this election, Republicans have registered new supporters in their effort to win re-election for President Trump, but the broad pattern is clear: Republicans are hostile to greater democracy, where democracy means equal representation in a federal system of separated powers. Name a proposal that would enlarge the scope of American democracy — more states, a national popular vote, a larger House of Representatives — and Republicans (or their conservative allies) are almost certain to oppose it. Some Republicans, notably Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, even oppose existing democratic reforms, like the direct election of senators. One way to understand this opposition to greater democracy is as a preference for political and constitutional stasis. And this makes sense. The power of the Republican Party in its present form rests on static institutions and a frozen politics. Ending (or radically reforming) the Electoral College would, as Graham said, make it more difficult for Republicans to elect a president, meaning they could no longer win a presidential race while losing the popular vote itself. Creating new states would disturb the balance of the Senate and possibly make it more difficult for Republicans to win a majority in the chamber. Expanding the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary would harm the Republican effort to undermine federal election protection and allow voter suppression and disenfranchisement. The Republican Party as currently constituted is a minority party representing a demographically narrow segment of the American electorate. It needs stasis — institutional and constitutional — to survive. Democrats do not. Just the opposite, they need a political system that can grow with and respond to change within our society. Progressive government is necessarily active government. And if we can speak of original intent, it was not the intent of the founders of this country to have a static government, a static constitutional order, or — for that matter — a static society. The question of whether Democrats will abolish the filibuster or expand the courts or create new states, should they win power, is actually a question of whether Democrats will bring dynamism to the American political system. The prospect is daunting. But if they have any desire to reverse the damage of the past four years — if they want to return to something like normalcy — then the path to stability begins with transformation. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/opin ... e=Homepage
Republicans speak with forked tongues. Their gerrymandering over the years, and all the shenanigans trying to stop Democrats from voting, show they have no respect for the concept of democracy.

2001552044,Dominion voting,19:00.0,Rebuking Lamb and Lion Ministries for promoting Dominion Theology; Wake up people! #EndTimes #False Teachers,https://www.thethirdheaventraveler.com/2020/10/rebuking-lamb-and-lion-ministries-for.html,thethirdheaventraveler.com,neutral,blog,en,,,,,,,2023-03-02T14:47:20.319+0000,,traveler andrew sheets,,,FALSE,,,,,,0,0,,0,,,"I want to open this article by stating that I am NOT a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent or any other political label out there. I am a Christian and I read my Bible. I stand strongly against this false teaching today of demanding Christians get active in politics. Shame on Dr. Reagan of Lamb and Lion for promoting this false teaching. This morning I received an email from Lamb and Lion Ministries title and link below: Lamb and Lion Ministries Newsletter: ""What's the responsibility of a Christian voter?"" https://christinprophecyblog.org/2020/10/prophetic-perspectives-103-the-election-omen/ I'm both saddened and disgusted that Lamb and Lion has morphed into another supporter of Dominion Theology. If you ask Dr. Reagan directly he'd probably vehemently deny this. But let's take a look at the evidence. In this article I will take each part and show where they allow the contributors to make outrageous claims that a Christian must vote the way Jesus would and that is is our duty to vote as a Christian. For new readers who do not understand the depths of the evils of Dominion Theology please read a few of my Blogs in notes below before continuing with this article. For my readers who are aware of Dominion Theology and the evils thereof and how it has taken over mainstream Christianity today, please continue reading. I will respond to the contributing author's comment in red letters: Marsha Kuhnley: ""The Apostle Paul teaches us in Ephesians 6:10-20 that Christians must put on the whole armor of God. Doing so is especially vitally important in these end times. Paul exhorts those wearing the whole armor of God in that passage to stand “strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” Therefore, Christians are meant to stay in an active mode. We wield our sword of truth, and one of the ways we can wield that sword of truth is by voting the way Jesus would have us vote."" Since most of Marsha Kuhnley's words in this article are taken from her book, ""The Election Omen"", I will address all her comments by addressing and refuting her book. In this book she teaches pure dominion theology in that Christians are required to be active on the political scene in making changes necessary for the end time prophetic events. In Chapter 1, your vote matters, she actually has the audacity to say that Christians like me who refuse to participate in the mockery of our 2 party system are the Laodiceans. I rebuke Marsha Kuhnley for taking these scriptures out of context and for her being a false teacher. Please read my blog below on why I haven't voted since 1972 and I pray you wake up. Marsha Kuhnley is a liar and false teacher when she writes on page 7 of chapter 1, ""this is a time when people have quit fighting God's battles."" She goes on further to say that we have to be zealous for God as Elijah and Paul and then in pure heretical teaching makes voting a part of this. Marsha doubles down and tries to tell us that the Bible actually talks about voting in Acts 26:10. Of course she uses a new bible translation and then takes that out of quote. Please see my link on why bible translations matter. Here's Marha's perverted bible translation for Acts 26:10: ""I gave my vote against them."" Here's what the King James Version correctly says, ""...I gave my voice against them."" Aside from wrong bible translations, it is absurd to take this passage and tell people that the Bible talks about our duty to vote. She then goes on for the next several pages using improper scripture translation and context to prove why old testament kings were voted by the people. I won't comment on the absolute absurdity of her trying to make voting a Biblical issue by the people laying down palms on Jesus' entry into Jerusalem. Nor will I comment on the mockery she makes of the Parables of Jesus are actually pointing to us today to vote. She ends Chapter 1 by insane comments on King David's battles to today's Christian and voting and fighting God's battles. Another smoking gun for pure dominion theology and ecumenical apostates. Please read notes below Chapter 2: Marsha dives off the cliff into an immoral abyss by telling us that Satan wants to steal our votes. In Chapter 3, she shockingly tries to use the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution as the pillars we should celebrate and then takes the likes of LBJ, MLK Jr. and Susan B Anthony, all truly against the true word of God, do your own research on why the 14 Amendment removed us from having any voice in our government and the real reason behind the 15th amendment and what LB Johnson did to minorities and worse to the church through the 501C3. ML King was as far from Jesus Christ as one can get. Please read Billy Graham and his friends by Dr. Burns. Chapters 4: Marsha gives us a good civics lesson in the Electoral College. Let me add 2 things: 1. A true democracy would be based on popular vote. A true republic would be based on electoral college. Since we're a republic, it stands to reason we'd have an elctoral college. 2. What does this civics lesson have to do with us as Christians? Please read my Blog ""Why I haven't voted since 1972"" to understand the 2 party system is ploy of the Council of Foreign Affairs and how we as Christians are not to get caught up in politics. Let me ask this question here for those will not read my Blogs that refute Marsha's false teaching. Why did the ""conservative supreme court""of 1973 uphold Roe vs Wade? Read quote: "" A 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, legalized abortion by a 7-2 vote. Six of the seven justices in the majority were Republican appointees. The only Democrat appointee, Byron White, voted against Roe v. Wade. In fact, in every year since 1969, the United States Supreme Court has been controlled by a majority of Republican-appointed judges. There has not been a Democrat-appointed Chief Justice since 1953. Currently, there are seven Republican appointees and two nominated by Democrats. Obviously, if the Republican majority has wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade at any time since 1973, they had the votes to do so. Why haven’t they? "" https://heraldcourier.com/news/roe-v-wade-approved-by-republican-appointees/article_4fa2fb82-d738-5a11-95b6-650037c19451.html Chapters 5 and 6: I will not comment other than to say she gets deeper and deeper in false teaching and apostasy of trying to shoe horn voting for a Republican and get the Democrats out of office and why this is the duty of every Christian. Chapter 7: ""Who would Jesus vote for?"" What a mockery. Using Marsha's own criteria, trust me, Jesus would NOT vote for Trump or Biden. Read what Jesus really thought about politics. Hint: Read all of Matthew 22; and why didn't Jesus get involved in getting John the Baptist out of prison? Why didn't Jesus call down a legion of angels to defend him? Why did Jesus rebuke James and John arguing about earthly political seats of power in this realm? Jesus came as a servant NOT a ruler. He doesn't want us controlling power in this realm. Chapter 8: ""Who would Satan vote for"". What a mockery. Satan has control over the entire systems of this world. It all belongs to him. He would vote for Trump and he would also vote for Biden. Since the Luciferion Elite appoint the world's leaders under the influence of Satan, you'd have to ask them. Instead of cherry picking wrong out of context scriptures why doesn't Marsha talk about 2 Timothy 2:4 King James Version 4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. Marsha saves the best of her apostate teaching for last: She has obviously read a lot of Jonathan Cahn's Harbinger and other Con games of Cahn. See my Blog. Marsha also reveals she's not only a Dominion Theologist, but she's embracing Replacement Theology trying to make the United States and Evangelical Christians the same as Israel, but she's on thin ice of Ecumenism by embracing all other institutions calling themselves Christian like the Catholics among others as being in the fight for God on issues such as abortion rights etc. This last chapter is also proving Marsha as a false prophet. She's trying to tell us that she is forecasting the same as Jonathan Cahn that the balance of America is weighing in the hands of Evangelicals to stand up and take their place. To call George Washington and our founders as God fearing Christian men is a mockery to every truly born again Christian. Please read my Blogs in notes below about the truth about Washington DC. and our founders. Tim Moore: I love the fact that you pointed out that Christians need to remain active. Matthew 16:18 tells us that the gates of Hell will not prevail when the Saints are marching forward. That means that Christians need to be proactive in declaring God’s truth and spreading “salt and light” in our own society. Voting is a key way we can do that. What should Christians look for when considering to vote for a particular candidate among the choices given in an election? Sadly Tim Moore is another Dominion Theology apostate touting Trump. He as do all Dominion Theology teachers takes cherry picked scripture after scripture completely out of context and out of the proper dispensation. See my Blog posts below on understanding dispensation and how to rightly divide the word of God. Marsha Kuhnley: Christians must keep a biblical perspective. The Bible provides us with many characteristics and causes to look for in terms of what a candidate supports. Right to life, being Pro-Life/Anti-Abortion, is a big one. What their stance is on the LGBTQ+ movement should match up to what the Bible makes very clear — that God made man and woman for each other and that He created marriage for a man and woman alone. Only a sanctified, covenant relationship should be upheld. Any sex outside of marriage is a sin, and the Bible is very clear about that. Those are two of the big issues Christians should be looking for when they pick a candidate for their vote. No comment other than read my Blog on the Trump MAGA Evangelical delusion. Also my comment on the 1973 Roe vs Wade Supreme Court notes above should wake up anyone asleep. Regarding the Social Gospel and taking up politics as a ""religious cause"" is pure dominionism and drives the follower toward ecumenism. See my Blogs. Tim Moore: Too often lately our religious liberties have been under attack, even in the United States. Christians should then look for candidates who will respect religious liberty and all American’s freedom to worship as they see fit. It seems like as of late Christianity has been under tremendous attacks all over the world. Read my Blog about the 501C3 Brick and Mortar Chruches run by apostate charlatan CEOs called Pastors to understand that the Tax Free Exemption most church building operations use is absolute control of the governement over church operations. I'm sure Tim Moore does not understand this, but most likely is blind to this truth. The blind leading the blind. Marsha Kuhnley: Yes, I couldn’t agree with you more. In the end times, deception will abound. One of these deceptions is the Equality Act. Congress has had this act on their legislative agenda. It has nothing to do with equality. In fact, this act directly attacks religious liberty. Christians should not vote for candidates who are hostile to religious liberty. The only thing I will say here in commentary is simply. Ask Marsha Kuhnley what Trump has done regarding the Equality Act and ask how many conservative republican lawmakers have approved these provisions. It passed the House of Representatives in a BI PARTISAN VOTE. Trump approves of many provisions of this bill. Research it for yourself his comments made in 2000 using LGBTQ rights the same as civil rights. Also, read my Blogs regarding the Hegelian Dialectic the Right vs Left. And finally again we see that through the use of the Supreme Court acting as legislators instead of justices of institutional law. The Equality Act received a major boost In June 2020 in a landmark win for the LGBTQ community, the United States Supreme Court affirmed that sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination are prohibited under Title VII, This is the meat of the Equality Act. See here once again how so called ""Christian Conservative Justices jumped ship with the Evangelicals. ""Gorsuch LGBT Republicans"" https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/15/gorsuch-lgbt-republicans-321096. Notice how Trump remained silent. The only problem republicans have with the bill is alienation of the conservative right Christian vote to maintain the perception Trump and the Republicans are fighting against the godless left. It's all about perception, smoke and mirrors. It has nothing whatsoever with God fearing moral men and women. IF THIS WERE THE CASE, our lawmakers would have overturned innumerable immoral laws, but lawlessness only increases. Wake Up! Tim Moore: Some Christians at times have argued that Christians should never “sully themselves” with politics and that we are “above all of that.” Why would we not want to defend our society against all of the deception that is raging around us today? No, rather we need to be engaged in society and we need to exercise our responsibility to vote. No comment. Please read my blogs. Tim Moore is clueless to what is actually happening today. Marsha Kuhnley: Yes, again, I couldn’t agree with you more. Revelation 3 speaks of the last church — the Church of Laodicea. One of the complaints Jesus had against that church is that they had this “I don’t care” attitude. Apostasy! Jesus called that church not to be like that. He wished that the Laodiceans were neither hot nor cold, not tepid and flavorless. Individual Christians can become like the Laodiceans. Jesus calls us not to be like that. Christians need to be hot. We cannot just sit on the sidelines with this “I don’t care” attitude saying, “I’m just going to sit here and wait until Jesus comes.” We are called to suit up, put our armor on, and vote! Marsha Kuhnley is a liar. She is teaching Apostasy not Christians who do NOT vote. This scripture has absolutely NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with voting. Dr. Reagan: ""Shame on you Sir! I Rebuke you for allowing this garbage on your website."" Tim Moore: That’s a good message for all Christians. As Marsha revealed — your vote matters. Recognize that voting is not just your American right, but it is also your Christian responsibility Tim Moore is a liar! IT is NOT a responsibility of a Christian to vote. Shame on Dr. Reagan for allowing this garbage.

Voice of America (VOA) is a state-controlled international television and radio network funded by the U.S. federal tax budget. It is the largest U.S. international broadcaster. VOA produces digital, TV, and radio content in 47 languages which it distributes to affiliate stations around the globe. It is primarily viewed by foreign audiences, so VOA programming has an influence on public opinion abroad regarding the United States and its people.[1] VOA was established in 1942,[2] and the VOA charter (Public Laws 94-350 and 103-415)[3] was signed into law in 1976 by President Gerald Ford. VOA is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, an independent agency of the U.S. government.[4] Funds are appropriated annually by Congress under the budget for embassies and consulates. In 2016, VOA broadcast an estimated 1,800 hours of radio and TV programming each week to approximately 236.6 million people worldwide with about 1,050 employees and a taxpayer-funded annual budget of US$218.5 million.[1][5] Some commentators consider Voice of America to be a form of propaganda.[6][7] In response to the request of the United States Department of Justice that RT register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Russia’s Justice Ministry labeled Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as foreign agents in December 2017.[8][9] Current languages[edit] The Voice of America website had five English language broadcasts as of 2014 (worldwide, Special English, Cambodia, Zimbabwe and Tibet). Additionally, the VOA website has versions in 46 foreign languages (radio programs are marked with an asterisk; TV programs with a plus symbol and icon ): The number of languages varies according to the priorities of the United States government and the world situation.[10][11] History[edit] American private shortwave broadcasting before World War II[edit] Before World War II, all American shortwave stations were in private hands.[12] Privately controlled shortwave networks included the National Broadcasting Company‘s International Network (or White Network), which broadcast in six languages,[13] the Columbia Broadcasting System‘s Latin American international network, which consisted of 64 stations located in 18 different countries,[14] the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, and General Electric which owned and operated WGEO and WGEA, both based in Schenectady, New York, and KGEI in San Francisco, all of which had shortwave transmitters. Experimental programming began in the 1930s, but there were fewer than 12 transmitters in operation.[15] In 1939, the Federal Communications Commission set the following policy: A licensee of an international broadcast station shall render only an international broadcast service which will reflect the culture of this country and which will promote international goodwill, understanding and cooperation. Any program solely intended for, and directed to an audience in the continental United States does not meet the requirements for this service.[16] This policy was intended to enforce the State Department’s Good Neighbor Policy, but some broadcasters felt that it was an attempt to direct censorship.[17] Shortwave signals to Latin America were regarded as vital to counter Nazi propaganda around 1940.[15] Initially, the Office of Coordination of Information sent releases to each station, but this was seen as an inefficient means of transmitting news.[12] The director of Latin American relations at the Columbia Broadcasting System was Edmund A. Chester, and he supervised the development of CBS’s extensive “La Cadena de las Americas” radio network to improve broadcasting to South America during the 1940s.[18] Also included among the cultural diplomacy programming on the Columbia Broadcasting System was the musical show Viva America (1942-1949) which featured the Pan American Orchestra and the artistry of several noted musicians from both North and South America, including Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Eva Garza, Elsa Miranda, Nestor Mesta Chaires, Miguel Sandoval, John Serry Sr., and Terig Tucci.[19][20][21] By 1945, broadcasts of the show were carried by 114 stations on CBS’s “La Cadena de las Americas” network in 20 Latin American nations. These broadcasts proved to be highly successful in supporting President Franklin Roosevelt‘s policy of Pan-Americanism throughout South America during World War II.[22] World War II[edit] Even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. government’s Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI, in Washington) had already begun providing war news and commentary to the commercial American shortwave radio stations for use on a voluntary basis through its Foreign Information Service (FIS, in New York) headed by playwright Robert E. Sherwood, the playwright who served as president Roosevelt’s speech writer and information advisor.[23] Direct programming began a week after the United States’ entry into World War II in December 1941, with the first broadcast from the San Francisco office of the FIS via General Electric’s KGEI transmitting to the Philippines in English (other languages followed). The next step was to broadcast to Germany, which was called Stimmen aus Amerika (“Voices from America”) and was transmitted on February 1, 1942. It was introduced by “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” and included the pledge: “Today, and every day from now on, we will be with you from America to talk about the war… The news may be good or bad for us – We will always tell you the truth.”[24] Roosevelt approved this broadcast, which then-Colonel William J. Donovan (COI) and Sherwood (FIS) had recommended to him. It was Sherwood who actually coined the term “The Voice of America” to describe the shortwave network that began its transmissions on February 1, from 270 Madison Avenue in New York City. The Office of War Information, when organized in the middle of 1942, officially took over VOA’s operations. VOA reached an agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation to share medium-wave transmitters in Britain, and expanded into Tunis in North Africa and Palermo and Bari, Italy as the Allies captured these territories. The OWI also set up the American Broadcasting Station in Europe.[25] Asian transmissions started with one transmitter in California in 1941; services were expanded by adding transmitters in Hawaii and, after recapture, the Philippines.[26] By the end of the war, VOA had 39 transmitters and provided service in 40 languages.[26] Programming was broadcast from production centers in New York and San Francisco, with more than 1,000 programs originating from New York. Programming consisted of music, news, commentary, and relays of U.S. domestic programming, in addition to specialized VOA programming.[27] About half of VOA’s services, including the Arabic service, were discontinued in 1945.[28] In late 1945, VOA was transferred to the Department of State. Cold War[edit] In 1947, VOA started broadcasting to the Soviet citizens in Russia under the pretext of countering “more harmful instances of Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies” on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media, according to John B. Whitton’s treatise, Cold War Propaganda.[29] The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic jamming of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.[29] Charles W. Thayer headed VOA in 1948–49. Over the next few years, the U.S. government debated the best role of Voice of America. The decision was made to use VOA broadcasts as a part of its foreign policy to fight the propaganda of the Soviet Union and other countries. The Arabic service resumed on January 1, 1950, with a half-hour program. This program grew to 14.5 hours daily during the Suez Crisis of 1956, and was six hours a day by 1958.[28] In 1952, Voice of America installed a studio and relay facility aboard a converted U.S. Coast Guard cutter renamed Courier whose target audience was Soviet Union and other members of Warsaw Pact. The Courier was originally intended to become the first in a fleet of mobile, radio broadcasting ships (see offshore radio) that built upon U.S. Navy experience during WWII in using warships as floating broadcasting stations. However, the Courier eventually dropped anchor off the island of Rhodes, Greece with permission of the Greek government to avoid being branded as a pirate radio broadcasting ship. This VOA offshore station stayed on the air until the 1960s when facilities were eventually provided on land. The Courier supplied training to engineers who later worked on several of the European commercial offshore broadcasting stations of the 1950s and 1960s. Control of VOA passed from the State Department to the U.S. Information Agency when the latter was established in 1953[28] to transmit worldwide, including to the countries behind the Iron Curtain and to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Starting in the 1950s, VOA broadcast American jazz on Voice of America Jazz Hour from 1955 until 2003. Hosted for most of that period by Willis Conover, the program had 30 million listeners at its peak. A program aimed at South Africa in 1956 broadcast two hours nightly, and special programs such as The Newport Jazz Festival were also transmitted. This was done in association with tours by U.S. musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington, sponsored by the State Department.[30] From August 1952 through May 1953, Billy Brown, a high school senior in Westchester County, New York, had a Monday night program in which he shared everyday happenings in Yorktown Heights, New York. Brown’s program ended due to its popularity: his “chatty narratives” attracted so much fan mail, VOA couldn’t afford the $500 a month in clerical and postage costs required to respond to listeners’ letters.[31] Throughout the Cold War, many of the targeted countries’ governments sponsored jamming of VOA broadcasts, which sometimes led critics to question the broadcasts’ actual impact. For example, in 1956, Polish People’s Republic stopped jamming VOA transmissions[citation needed], but People’s Republic of Bulgaria continued to jam the signal through the 1970s. Chinese language VOA broadcasts were jammed beginning in 1956 and extending through 1976.[32] However, after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, interviews with participants in anti-Soviet movements verified the effectiveness of VOA broadcasts in transmitting information to socialist societies.[33] The People’s Republic of China diligently jams VOA broadcasts.[34] Cuba has also been reported to interfere with VOA satellite transmissions to Iran from its Russian-built transmission site at Bejucal.[35] David Jackson, former director of Voice of America, noted: “The North Korean government doesn’t jam us, but they try to keep people from listening through intimidation or worse. But people figure out ways to listen despite the odds. They’re very resourceful.”[36] Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, VOA covered some of the era’s most important news, including Martin Luther King Jr.‘s 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech and Neil Armstrong‘s 1969 first walk on the Moon. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, VOA broadcast around-the-clock in Spanish.[examples needed] In the early 1980s, VOA began a $1.3 billion rebuilding program to improve broadcast with better technical capabilities. Also in the 1980s, VOA also added a television service, as well as special regional programs to Cuba, Radio Martí and TV Martí. Cuba has consistently attempted to jam such broadcasts and has vociferously protested U.S. broadcasts directed at Cuba. In September 1980, VOA started broadcasting to Afghanistan in Dari and in Pashto in 1982. At the same time, VOA started to broadcast U.S. government editorials, clearly separated from the programming by audio cues. In 1985, VOA Europe was created as a special service in English that was relayed via satellite to AM, FM, and cable affiliates throughout Europe. With a contemporary format including live disc jockeys, the network presented top musical hits as well as VOA news and features of local interest (such as “EuroFax”) 24 hours a day. VOA Europe was closed down without advance public notice in January 1997 as a cost-cutting measure.[37] It was followed by VOA Express, which from July 4, 1999 revamped into VOA Music Mix. Since November 1, 2014 stations are offered VOA1 (which is a rebranding of VOA Music Mix). In 1989, Voice of America expanded its Mandarin and Cantonese programming to reach the millions of Chinese and inform the country about the pro-democracy movement within the country, including the demonstration in Tiananmen Square. Starting in 1990, the U.S. consolidated its international broadcasting efforts, with the establishment of the Bureau of Broadcasting. Post–Cold War[edit] With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe, VOA added many additional language services to reach those areas. This decade was marked by the additions of Tibetan, Kurdish (to Iran and Iraq), Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Macedonian, and Rwanda-Rundi language services. In 1993, the Clinton administration advised cutting funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as it was felt post-Cold War information and influence was not needed in Europe. This plan was not well received, and he then proposed the compromise of the International Broadcasting Act. The Broadcasting Board of Governors was established and took control from the Board for International Broadcasters which previously oversaw funding for RFE/RL.[38] In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the International Broadcasting Act into law. This law established the International Broadcasting Bureau as a part of the U.S. Information Agency and created the Broadcasting Board of Governors with oversight authority. In 1998, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act was signed into law and mandated that BBG become an independent federal agency as of October 1, 1999. This act also abolished the U.S.I.A. and merged most of its functions with those of the State Department. In 1994, Voice of America became the first[39] broadcast-news organization to offer continuously updated programs on the Internet. In April 2020, the Trump administration accused Voice of America of being a mouthpiece for authoritarian regimes that “speaks for America’s adversaries,” and of “promoting propaganda” instead of “promoting freedom and democracy.”[40][41][42] Cuts in services[edit] The Arabic Service was abolished in 2002 and replaced by a new radio service, called the Middle East Radio Network or Radio Sawa, with an initial budget of $22 million. Radio Sawa offered mostly Western and Middle Eastern popular songs with periodic brief news bulletins. Today, the network has expanded to television with Alhurra and to various social media and websites.[43] On May 16, 2004; Worldnet, a satellite television service, was merged into the VOA network. Radio programs in Russian ended in July 2008.[44] In September 2008, VOA eliminated the Hindi language service after 53 years.[44] Broadcasts in Ukrainian, Serbian, Macedonian and Bosnian also ended.[45] These reductions were part of American efforts to concentrate more resources to broadcast to the Muslim world.[44][45] In September 2010, VOA began its radio broadcasts in Sudan. As U.S. interests in South Sudan have grown, there is a desire to provide people with free information.[46] In 2013, VOA ended foreign language transmissions on shortwave and medium wave to Albania, Georgia, Iran and Latin America; as well as English language broadcasts to the Middle East and Afghanistan.[47] The movement was done due to budget cuts.[47] On July 1, 2014, VOA cut most of its shortwave transmissions in English to Asia.[48] Shortwave broadcasts in Azerbaijani, Bengali, Khmer, Kurdish, Lao, and Uzbek were dropped too.[48] On August 11, 2014, the Greek service ended after 72 years on air.[49][50] List of languages[edit] Language[51] Target audience from to Website Remarks English Worldwide 1942 present www.voanews.com Mandarin Chinese Republic of China (1941-1949)

From its founding in 1942 to 1945, it was part of the Office of War Information, and then from 1945 to 1953 as a function of the State Department. VOA was placed under the U.S. Information Agency in 1953. When the USIA was abolished in 1999, VOA was placed under the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or BBG, which is an autonomous U.S. government agency, with bipartisan membership. The Secretary of State has a seat on the BBG.[52] The BBG was established as a buffer to protect VOA and other U.S.-sponsored, non-military, international broadcasters from political interference. It replaced the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) that oversaw the funding and operation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a branch of VOA.[38] Smith–Mundt Act[edit] From 1948 until its amendment in 2013, Voice of America was forbidden to broadcast directly to American citizens under § 501 of the Smith–Mundt Act.[6] The act was amended as a result of the passing of the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2013.[7] The intent of the legislation in 1948 was to protect the American public from propaganda actions by their own government and to have no competition with private American companies.[53] The amendment had the intent of adapting to the Internet and allow American citizens to request access to VOA content.[54] Internal policies[edit] VOA charter[edit] Under the Eisenhower administration in 1959, VOA Director Henry Loomis commissioned a formal statement of principles to protect the integrity of VOA programming and define the organization’s mission, and was issued by Director George V. Allen as a directive in 1960 and was endorsed in 1962 by USIA director Edward R. Murrow.[55] The principles were signed into law on July 12, 1976, by President Gerald Ford. It reads: The long-range interests of the United States are served by communicating directly with the peoples of the world by radio. To be effective, the Voice of America must win the attention and respect of listeners. These principles will therefore govern Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts. 1. VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive. 2. VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions. 3. VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.[4] “Firewall”[edit] The Voice of America Firewall was put in place with the 1976 VOA Charter and laws passed in 1994 and 2016 as a way of ensuring the integrity of VOA’s journalism. This policy fights against propaganda and promotes unbiased and objective journalistic standards in the agency. The charter is one part of this firewall and the other laws assist in ensuring high standards of journalism.[56] “Two-source rule”[edit] According to former VOA correspondent Alan Heil, the internal policy of VOA News is that any story broadcast must have two independently corroborating sources or have a staff correspondent witness an event.[57] Newsroom[edit] Voice of America’s central newsroom has hundreds of journalists and dozens of full-time domestic and overseas correspondents, who are employees of the U.S. government or paid contractors. They are augmented by hundreds of contract correspondents and stringers throughout the world, who file in English or in one of VOA’s other radio and television broadcast languages. In late 2005, VOA shifted some of its central-news operation to Hong Kong where contracted writers worked from a “virtual” office with counterparts on the overnight shift in Washington, D.C., but this operation was shut down in early 2008. Shortwave frequencies[edit] By December 2014, the number of transmitters and frequencies used by VOA had been greatly reduced. VOA still uses shortwave transmissions to cover some areas of Africa and Asia. Shortwave broadcasts still take place in these languages: Afaan Oromoo, Amharic, Bambara, Cantonese, Chinese, English, Indonesian, Korean an",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Swahili. VOA Radiogram[edit] VOA Radiogram was an experimental Voice of America program starting in March 2013 which transmitted digital text and images via shortwave radiograms.[58] There were 220 editions of the program, transmitted each weekend from the Edward R. Murrow transmitting station. The audio tones that comprised the bulk of each 30 minute program were transmitted via an analog transmitter, and could be decoded using a basic AM shortwave receiver with freely downloadable software of the Fldigi family. This software is available for Windows, Apple (OSX), Linux, and FreeBSD systems. Broadcasts can also be decoded using the free TIVAR app from the Google Play store using any Android device. The mode used most often on VOA Radiogram, for both text and images, was MFSK32, but other modes were also occasionally transmitted. The final edition of VOA Radiogram was transmitted during the weekend of June 17–18,2017, a week before the retirement of the program producer from VOA. An offer to continue the broadcasts on a contract basis was declined,[59] so a follow-on show called Shortwave Radiogram began transmission on June 25, 2017 from the WRMI transmitting site in Okeechobee, Florida.[60] Shortwave Radiogram program schedule[61] Day Time (UTC) Shortwave frequency (MHz) Origin Saturday 1600–1630 9.4 Space Line, Bulgaria Sunday 0600–0630 7.73 WRMI, Florida Sunday 2030–2100 11.58 WRMI, Florida Sunday 2330–2400 11.58 WRMI, Florida Transmission facilities[edit] One of VOA’s radio transmitter facilities was originally based on a 625-acre (2.53 km2) site in Union Township (now West Chester Township) in Butler County, Ohio, near Cincinnati. The site is now a recreational park with a lake, lodge, dog park, and Voice of America museum. The Bethany Relay Station operated from 1944 to 1994.[62] Other former sites include California (Dixon, Delano), Hawaii, Okinawa, (Monrovia) Liberia, Costa Rica, Belize, and at least two in Greece.[citation needed] Between 1983 and 1990, VOA made significant upgrades to transmission facilities in Botswana, Morocco, Thailand, Kuwait, and Sao Tome.[63] Currently, VOA and USAGM continue to operate shortwave radio transmitters and antenna farms at International Broadcasting Bureau Greenville Transmitting Station in the United States, close to Greenville, North Carolina, “Site B.” They do not use FCC-issued callsigns, since the FCC does not regulate communications by other federal government agencies. (The FCC regulates broadcasting by private companies and other businesses, state governments, nonprofit organizations [NPOs] and non-government organizations [NGOs], and private individuals.) The IBB also operates a transmission facility on São Tomé and (Tinang) Concepcion, Tarlac, Philippines for VOA.[64] Comparing VOA-RFE-RL-RM to other broadcasters[edit] In 1996, the U.S.’s international radio output consisted of 992 hours per week by VOA, 667 by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and 162 by Radio Marti. Controversies[edit] Mullah Omar interview[edit] In late September 2001, VOA aired a report that contained brief excerpts of an interview with then Taliban leader Mullah Omar Mohammad, along with segments from President Bush’s post-9/11 speech to Congress, an expert in Islam from Georgetown University,[who?] and comments by the foreign minister of Afghanistan’s anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. State Department officials including Richard Armitage and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views.[citation needed] In response, reporters and editors argued for the VOA’s editorial independence from its governors.[citation needed] VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the University of Oregon‘s Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism.[65] Abdul Malik Rigi interview[edit] On April 2,2007, Abdul Malik Rigi, the leader of Jundullah, a militant group with possible links to al-Qaeda, appeared on Voice of America’s Persian language service. VOA introduced Rigi as “the leader of popular Iranian resistance movement.”[66][unreliable source?][verification needed] The interview resulted in public condemnation by the Iranian-American community, as well as the Iranian government.[67][68] Jundullah is a militant organization that has been linked to numerous attacks on civilians, such as the 2009 Zahedan explosion.[69][70] Tibetan protester interview[edit] In February 2013, a documentary released by China Central Television interviewed a Tibetan self-immolator who failed to kill himself. The interviewee said he was motivated by Voice of America’s broadcasts of commemorations of people who committed suicide in political self-immolation. VOA denied any allegations of instigating self-immolations and demanded that the Chinese station retract its report.[71] Trump presidency politicization efforts[edit] After the inauguration of US President Donald Trump, several tweets by Voice of America (one of which was later removed) seemed to support the widely criticized statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer about the crowd size and biased media coverage. This first raised concerns over possible attempts by Trump to politicize the state-funded agency.[72][73][74][75] This amplified already growing propaganda concerns over the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, signed into law by Barack Obama, which replaced the board of the Broadcasting Board of Governors with a CEO appointed by the president. Trump sent two of his political aides, Matthew Ciepielowski and Matthew Schuck, to the agency to aid its current CEO during the transition to the Trump administration. Criticism was raised over Trump’s choice of aides; Schuck was a staff writer for right-wing website The Daily Surge until April 2015, while Ciepielowski was a field director at the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.[72] VOA officials responded with assurances that they would not become “Trump TV”.[72] BBG head John F. Lansing told NPR that it would be illegal for the administration to tell VOA what to broadcast, while VOA director Amanda Bennett stressed that while “government-funded”, the agency is not “government-run”.[74] On April 10,2020, the White House published an article in its daily newsletter critical of VOA coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.[76] Emails revealed in a Freedom of Information Act request showed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) press official Michawn Rich had sent a memo to agency employees stating in part, “as a rule, do not send up [interview] requests for Greta Van Susteren or anyone affiliated with Voice of America,” referencing the White House story.[77] On April 30, the Washington Post reported Vice President Mike Pence‘s office “threatened to retaliate against a reporter who revealed that Pence’s office had told journalists they would need masks for Pence’s visit to the Mayo Clinic — a requirement Pence himself did not follow.”[78] On June 3,2020, the Senate confirmed Michael Pack, a maker of conservative documentaries and close ally of Steve Bannon, to serve as head of the United States Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA.[79] Subsequently, Director Bennet and deputy director Sandy Sugawara resigned from VOA. CNN reported on June 16 that plans for a leadership shakeup at VOA were being discussed, including the possibility that controversial former White House aide Sebastian Gorka would be given a leadership role at VOA.[80] On June 17, the heads of VOA’s Middle East Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Open Technology Fund were all fired, their boards were dissolved and external communications from VOA employees made to require approval from senior agency personnel in what one source described as an “unprecedented” move, while Jeffrey Shapiro, like Pack a Bannon ally, was rumored to be in line to head the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.[81] Four former members of the advisory boards subsequently filed suit challenging Pack’s standing to fire them.[82] On July 9, NPR reported VOA would not renew the work visas of dozens of non-resident reporters, many of whom could face repercussions in their home countries.[83] In late July, four contracters and the head of VOA’s Urdu language service were suspended after a video featuring extensive clips from a Muslim-American voter conference, including a campaign message from Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden, was determined not to meet editorial standards and taken down.[84] On August 12,2020, USAGM chief financial officer Grant Turner and general counsel David Kligerman were removed from their positions and stripped of their security clearances, reportedly for their opposition to what Turner called “gross mismanagement,” along with four other senior agency officials.[85] Politico reported on August 13 that Trump administration official and former shock jock Frank Wuco had been hired as a USAGM senior advisor, responsible for auditing the agency’s office of policy and research.[86] As a radio host, Wuco issued insults and groundless claims against former US President Barack Obama, CIA Director John O. Brennan and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.[87] VOA’s Twitter account during this period featured stories favorable to Vice President Mike Pence and White House advisor Ivanka Trump.[88] In response to Pack’s August 27 interview with The Federalist website in which he “joked…about deporting his own employees and forcing them to adopt unsafe workplace practices that could expose them to COVID-19” and “said the agency was ripe for espionage and possibly rife with spies,”[89] a group of VOA journalists sent a letter to VOA Acting Director Elez Biberaj complaining that his “comments and decisions ‘endanger the personal security of VOA reporters at home and abroad, as well as threatening to harm U.S. national security objectives.'”[90] VOA’s response was that that “it would not respond directly to the letter because it was ‘improper’ and ‘failed to follow procedure.’ Instead, the leadership of USAGM and VOA ‘are handling the choice of complaint transmission as an administrative issue,’ which suggested that the journalists could face sanctions for their letter,” according to the Washington Post. In the same story, the Post reported that VOA Spanish-language service White House correspondent’s Brigo Segovia’s interview with an official about the administration’s response to Pack’s personnel and other moves had been censored and his own access to VOA’s computer system restricted.[91] On September 29, six senior USAGM officials filed a whistleblower complaint in which they alleged that Pack or one of his aides had ordered research conducted into the voting history of at least one agency employee, which would be a violation of laws protecting civil servants from undue political influence.[92] NPR reported that two Pack aides had compiled a report on VoA White House bureau chief Steven L. Herman‘s social media postings and other writings in an attempt to charge him with a conflict of interest, and that the agency released a conflict of interest policy stating in part that a “journalist who on Facebook ‘likes’ a comment or political cartoon that aggressively attacks or disparages the President must recuse themselves from covering the President.”[93] Suspended officials from Voice of America sued the agency news outlet on October 8. They accused its chief operating officer, Michael Pack, of using Voice of America as a vehicle to promote the personal agenda of President Trump and of violating a statutory firewall intended to prevent political interference with the agency, and they are seeking their reinstatement.[94] Guo Wengui interview[edit] On April 19,2017, VOA interviewed the Chinese real estate tycoon Guo Wengui in a live broadcast. The whole interview was scheduled for 3 hours. After Guo Wengui alleged to own evidence of corruption among the members of the Politburo Standing Committee of China, the highest political authority of China, the interview was abruptly cut off, after only one hour and seventeen minutes of broadcasting. Guo’s allegations involved Fu Zhenhua and Wang Qishan, the latter being a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and the leader of the massive anti-graft movement.[95] It was reported that Beijing warned VOA’s representatives not to interview Guo for his “unsubstantiated allegations”.[96] Four members of the U.S. Congress requested the Office of Inspector General to conduct an investigation into this interruption on August 27, 2017.[97] The OIG investigation concluded that the decision to curtail the Guo interview was based solely on journalistic best practices rather than any pressure from the Chinese government.[98] Another investigation,[98] by Mark Feldstein, Chair of Broadcast Journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park and a journalist with decades of experiences as an award-winning television investigative reporter, concluded that “The failure to comply with leadership’s instructions during the Guo interview “was a colossal and unprecedented violation of journalistic professionalism and broadcast industry standards.” The report also said that “There had been a grossly negligent approach” to pre-interview vetting and failure to “corroborate the authenticity of Guo’s evidence or interview other sources” in violation of industry standards. The interview team apparently “demonstrated greater loyalty to its source than to its employer — at the expense of basic journalistic standards of accuracy, verification, and fairness,” the Feldstein report concluded.[98] The VOA and the Cold War[edit] The VOA started its operations during the Cold War and that is when its influence first started as well. Foy Kohler, the director of VOA during the Cold War, strongly believed that the VOA was serving its purpose, which he identified as aiding in the fight against communism.[99] He argued that the numbers of listeners they were getting such as 194,000 regular listeners in Sweden, and 2.1 million regular listeners in France, was an indication of a positive impact. As further evidence, he noted that the VOA received 30,000 letters a month from listeners all over the world, and hundreds of thousands of requests for broadcasting schedules.[100] There was an analysis done of some of those letters sent in 1952 and 1953 while Kohler was still director. The study found that letter writing could be an indicator of successful, actionable persuasion. It was also found that broadcasts in different countries were having different effects. In one country, regular listeners adopted and practiced American values presented by the broadcast. Age was also a factor: younger and older audiences tended to like different types of programs no matter the country.[101] Kohler used all of this as evidence to claim that the VOA helped to grow and strengthen the free world. It also influenced the UN in their decision to condemn communist actions in Korea, and was a major factor in the decline of communism in the “free world, including key countries such as Italy and France.[99] In Italy, the VOA did not just bring an end to communism, but it caused the country to Americanize.[102] The VOA also had an impact behind the Iron Curtain. Practically all defectors during Kohler’s time claimed the VOA helped in their decision to defect. Another indication of impact, according to Kohler, was the Soviet response. Kohler argued that the soviets responded because the VOA was having an impact. Based on Soviet responses, it can be presumed that the most effective programs were ones that compared the lives of those behind and outside the iron curtain, questions on the practice of slave labor, as well as lies and errors in Stalin’s version of Marxism.[99] DEEWA Radio’s impact[edit] DEEWA Radio, of the VOA, airs in Pakistan. Although some listeners are suspicious that the program is promoting an American agenda, others claim to be experiencing a positive effect. Some listeners feel that the programs are giving a voice to the voiceless, leading them to a sense of empowerment.[103] VOA in Kurdistan and Iran[edit] VOA’s service in Iran has had a negative impact on Kurds and Kurdistan according to the publication, Kurdish Life. They claim that the VOA has exacerbated the conflict between the Talabani and the Barzani.[104] They further claim that the VOA is covering up wrongful imprisonments, wrongful arrests, and the building of extremist mosques. According to the same publication, Kurds are being turned into fanatics, and a new generation of terrorists is forming because of the VOA. They claim the VOA is doing this to help PUK.[105] VOA and Latin America[edit] There is evidence to suggest that the people who listen to the Latin American service are being influenced, but not in the way the VOA wants. Instead of understanding and adopting the American way of life, listeners are parroting values and beliefs that do not mesh with their lives. However, others have adopted a negative view of America, because they think that the VOA is propaganda.[106] VOA and China[edit] A study was done on Chinese students in America. It found that through the VOA, they disapproved of the actions of the Chinese government.[107] Another study was done on Chinese scholars in America, and found that the VOA had an effect on their political beliefs. Their political beliefs did not change in relation to China, though, as they did not tend to believe the VOA’s reports on China.[108] See also[edit] References[edit] * ^ a b Borchers, Callum (January 26, 2017). “Voice of America says it won’t become Trump TV”.

La estructura fue atacada por manifestantes encapuchados en momentos en que transcurrían varias horas de manifestación pacífica en los alrededores de la Plaza Italia, donde celebraron el inicio del estallido social del 18 de octubre de 2019. Cuando la iglesia ardía, bomberos y rescatistas hicieron un cerco para evitar que el colapso de la estructura impactara sobre la gente. Cerca de la iglesia colapsada por el ataque incendiario, otro templo fue saqueado e incendiado, pero los bomberos lograron apagar las llamas sin que pasara a mayores© AFP MARTIN BERNETTI “Que caiga, que caiga”, gritaron algunos encapuchados, que celebraron la posterior caída de la cúpula de la pequeña iglesia, conocida también como la “parroquia de los artistas”, según recuerda la prensa local. Más temprano, muy cerca de donde se produjo este incendio, otro templo fue saqueado e incendiado, pero los bomberos lograron apagar las llamas sin que pasara a mayores. La manifestación de este domingo se produce a una semana del plebiscito en que los chilenos decidirán si cambian o no la Constitución que se mantiene como herencia de la dictadura de Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). El referéndum fue convocado tras un amplio acuerdo político alcanzado tras semanas de violentas protestas el año pasado. Varias encuestas coinciden en que la opción para aprobar el cambio constitucional podría ganar con más del 60% de los votos, tras un año en que el reclamo por un mayor bienestar social tiene un respaldo transversal en la sociedad, así como también una contundente condena a la violencia en las calles.

Now, before I even start this, yes I already got the trophy when seasons were active back in 2014 (if you look at my profile). I know there are games that became 100%/platinum trophy unobtainable due to server closure or glitched trophies in the trophy (like ""Dominion"" trophy for Infinite Warfare) list I believe trophies like this and the one from GTA V should be whitelisted. I have seen players get flagged for this game for getting their entire trophy list auto-popped due to hackers. I mean from my perspective, ""Who cares if someone gets Big Leagues trophy auto-popped? If they got everything else legit, then I think they're qualified enough to get this trophy. Even ""Giant Accomplishment"" 6 times more rarer than ""Big Leagues"" trophy and I doubt even if Big Leagues trophy gets whitelisted, it wouldn't do to change platinum/100% completed on psnprofiles due to Black Ops 2 platinum trophy in general being very difficult to obtain first of all. Also, I have experienced hackers on this game auto-popping my BO2 trophy list on Xbox 360. I was in a public zombies lobby back in 2017 when Microsoft announced Call of Duty Black Ops II became backwards compatible on Xbox One so many of my friends and I hopped onto Black Ops II to have some good old times. However, when a friend of mine and I hopped onto the public zombies lobby, hacker auto-popped all of our yet unattained achievements for that game without any pop-ups nor warnings on our screen (meaning we were caught surprised out from blue). Usually, when hackers are about to auto-pop trophies/achievements for Black Ops II, you should see something like, ""unlocking all achievements"", etc. I have saw such screen on PS3 and Xbox 360, and when I do come across such pop-up messages, I back out in order to avoid getting illegitimate trophies/achievements auto-popped. But the public zombies lobby my friend and I were in, that was not the case. Even after backing out from the modded lobby, we thought that was the end of it, however achievements were still auto-popping. So even if you think you are in a hack-free lobby, there could be a hacker in the lobby waiting for him/her to auto-pop every single one of trophies for everyone without a notice. So I think this one of the reason why the entire Black Ops II trophy list should be whitelisted (if not, then whitelist strictly Big Leagues trophy only). Now I know some people might say, ""I mean you were playing on Xbox 360 right? Well that's different console"". True, but you can't deny the fact it's basically same game at the end of the day. Now, this is NOT a free pass to seek hackers auto-pop trophies since I also condemn cheating/hacking/modding at all cost. On a note, if someone gets their trophy list auto-popped, then they should either get flagged (not a flag like the one we have today), but wouldn't count toward two flagged game rules and leaderboard points. But if they only got Big Leagues popped by a hacker/cheater/modder (or whatever you like to call those a**holes who ruin the game), then that's fair and I believe they should get counted toward leaderboard. I am going to get sidetracked a bit, but if they use save files for games without encryption to get trophies, then they should get flagged for it. But for games like Call of Duty World at War, Call of Duty Black Ops II, and Grand Theft Auto V, it should be treated differently from others (I meant if you get hacked on either or all three games I just said, and get 3 or more trophies illegitimately, then it shouldn't get counted toward leaderboard points nor be on fastest/100% leaderboard, but shouldn't have to be counted two flagged games rules that we have right now. Only apply those two flagged games on games where it's possible to use save files without encryption to auto-pop their entire trophy list for some certain games like FIFA 09, Super Meat Boy, and you name them). On a side note, I believe Cheater Removals Team (not saying this as a hate toward CRT, nor I hate what CRT are doing) should invest their time on punishing people who do cheat to get their trophies from games like ""Super Meat Boy"", ""FIFA 09"", PS Vita games, by editing timestamps, or any other games without encryption where you could use save files to auto-pop your entire trophy lists within minute or two. Also, I am not trying to start a flame war between the community. I think this is the only way to stop this discussion once and for all by voting on this poll. If you believe this trophy should be whitelisted, then awesome! You and I share the same feeling! If you're against it? That's fine, I could understand why people would disagree with my opinion! If you can't make either decision, that's fine, that's no problem! I could also understand this topic is hard for some people to answer either yes or no! You don't care about it? That's fine! Hope you have a nice day though (in positive way) Also, I am not a native English speaker so if I wrote something that made you think this passage is poorly worded, please forgive me.

The televised images included hundreds of people standing in line waiting to vote, polling stations kept open past the closing hour to accommodate people already in line, insufficient numbers of machines in some places, machines with technical problems in others, and poll workers uncertain of procedures. Reports that just weeks before the general election, the state is fixing a software problem in its new, $104 million voting machines, combined with concerns about the handling of an anticipated record number of absentee ballots, have done little to lesson anxieties. Get The AJT Newsletter by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up Turnout by the state’s more than 7.4 million voters could approach the record 75.6 percent of eligible voters who cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election. State officials have suggested that as many as 1.5 million absentee ballots may be filed, with another 2 million people taking advantage of in-person early voting, and 2 million expected to vote on Election Day. To help you with the nuts and bolts of the election, here are some basic how-tos: Dates to Remember The deadline to register to vote in the general election was Oct. 5. Early voting began Oct. 12 and runs through Oct. 30. On election day, about 2,500 polling places will open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m., unless circumstances warrant keeping open individual locations, as was done in the primary. Any runoffs necessary for state and local offices will take place Dec. 1 and for federal offices Jan. 5. A runoff is likely in one of two U.S. Senate races and possible in the other. Absentee Ballots More than 1.15 million people voted absentee in the primary, totaling nearly half the ballots cast. Slightly more than 14 percent of the primary ballots were cast in early voting and more than 37 percent on June 9. For the general election, the state did not send absentee ballot applications to all registered voters, as it did in advance of the primary. Still, by Oct. 7, more than 1.5 million people had applied for absentee ballots, including through an online portal the secretary of state’s office unveiled in August. The state also created an online tracking system for people to track the progress of their application. According to data compiled at Georgia Votes, as of Oct. 5, the majority of absentee ballot applications statewide came from whites (53.1 percent, as well as 30.8 percent from African-Americans) and women (56.9 percent), with shy of half (44.8 percent) from voters age 65 and older. Of note, 30 percent came from people who did not vote in 2016 and 28.6 percent from people who did not vote in 2018. Absentee ballots can be mailed back to county election offices, taken to county election offices, or dropped off at designated lock-box locations. As this article was written, the deadline for return of absentee ballots had been restored to 7 p.m. Nov. 3, as the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a lower court ruling that would have required counting ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 but received later. Now, absentee ballots mailed too close to Election Day could be disqualified if they arrive after the deadline. The state has given the counties a green light to begin scanning absentee ballots two weeks and a day before Election Day, but no votes will be tabulated until Nov. 3. A survey of 1,150 likely Georgia voters — conducted Sept. 11–20 by the University of Georgia’s School of Public & International Affairs for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution — found that 26.7 percent planned to vote by absentee ballot, 36.8 percent in early voting, and 33.9 percent on Election Day. A Quinnipiac University Poll of 1,125 likely Georgia voters — conducted September 23–27, with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points — found supporters of President Donald Trump three times more likely than backers of former vice president Joe Biden to vote in person on Election Day (65 percent to 22 percent); Biden’s supporters more than three times as likely to use mail-in/absentee ballots (36 percent to 11 percent) and substantially more likely to vote in person during early voting (41 percent to 23 percent). Voting Machines Nov. 3 will be the largest test of the new machines, manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, which are designed to back up the computer screens with a paper trail, a system that critics say still remains open to tampering. Election integrity activists have appealed to a federal judge, asking that the state not use the new machines and instead use hand-marked paper ballots for the election. Not that further controversy was needed, but in early October, election officials were applying a software fix to the system, related to the size of the ballot for the all-comers to fill the unexpired two years in the term of retired Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson. There are 21 names on the ballot but not all fit on a single computer screen during testing. Thus, a fix weeks before Election Day. On June 9, problems were reported in nearly two dozen counties, the epicenter being Fulton County, where waits of several hours were reported at polling places (most notably at the Park Tavern near Piedmont Park), along with missing voting equipment and inexperienced poll workers. COVID-19 played a role in the large number of absentee ballots cast in the primary. The virus made some regular polling places unavailable and kept home many regular poll workers, who tend to be older members of the population. Various groups have been trying to convince more young people to serve as poll workers in November. The state hoped to recruit 25,000 people for this duty. In addition to increased training for the poll workers, the state plans to add additional voting machines and ballot scanners at polling places. Voting Demographics Nationally, more than half (56 percent) of those voting in 2016 were age 50 and older, according to the Pew Research Center. Jewish turnout in presidential elections nationally hovers around 80 percent. The Jewish Electorate Institute says that 29 percent of Georgia’s Jewish population is age 65 and older, compared with 19 percent of the state as a whole. Given the propensity of both Jews and older people to vote in percentages greater than the population in general, the votes of older Jews could help sway the balance in close races, such as the state’s two Senate seats. Voters under age 25 make up the fastest-growing segment of the electorate, doubling from 6 percent in 2016 to 12.3 percent in 2020, according to the secretary of state’s office. Voters under age 35 comprise 31 percent of the electorate, compared with 23 percent in 2016, according to an analysis by the AJC. At the other end of the age spectrum, the percentage of voters older than 65 declined from 24.3 percent in 2016 to 19.3 percent in 2020. The secretary of state’s office reported in February that 52.9 percent of registered voters self-identified as white, down from 56.7 percent in 2016. The African American percentage of 29.6 in 2020 was a fraction less than the 30 percent in 2016. Hispanics numbered 3.3 percent of the 2020 electorate, up from 2.3 percent in 2016, while the Asian Pacific population increased to 2.4 percent in 2020 from 1.8 in 2016. The state reported the racial identification of 10.2 percent to be unknown in 2020.

The judge in the latest case had several pages dedicated to the insecurities of the devices, but in the end ruled against the plaintiffs. https://coaltionforgoodgovernance.sharefile.com/share/view/sb0e8c40f4204bcfb The Plaintiffs� national cybersecurity experts convincingly present evidence that this is not a question of �might this actually ever happen?� � but �when it will happen,� especially if further protective measures are not taken. Given the masking nature of malware and the current systems described here, if the State and Dominion simply stand by and say, �we have never seen it,� the future does not bode well. Still, this is year one for Georgia in implementation of this new BMD system as the first state in the nation to embrace statewide implementation of this QR barcode-based BMD system for its entire population. Electoral dysfunction � cyber or otherwise � should not be desired as a mode of proof. It may well land unfortunately on the State's doorstep. The Court certainly hopes not. The Court recognizes the major challenges facing the Secretary of State's Office in rapidly implementing a new statewide voting system. Yet the vital issues identified in this case will not disappear or be appropriately addressed without focused State attention, resources, ongoing serious evaluation by independent cybersecurity experts, and open-mindedness. The Secretary of State and Dominion are obviously not without resources to tackle these issues.

Fulton is complying with the States ill-considered instructions, despite the fact that such actions are in plainly in violation of the Georgia Election Code. You and the Board Members will recall that the Secretary unfairly blamed the Board for the complete meltdown that was the June Presidential Primary. The Secretary is either deliberately setting up the Board again to take the blame for another meltdown, or is recklessly unable to deploy its new systems in compliance with state law or federal constitutional requirements. Either way, the Board should not, and as a matter of Georgia law, cannot,allow it to continue. We are confident that if the Board is made aware of these statutory violations that it will immediately bring Fulton County into compliance. The Board can do so by invoking the provisions for O.C.G.A. § 21-2-281, which allow the Board to switch to hand marked paper ballots in the event that using the BMDs is impossible or impracticable. The conditions are expanded by State Election Board Rule 183-1-12-.11(2)(c)stating that if the BMDs are unusable,impracticable or impossible for voting(c), and183-1-12-.11(2)(d) adding that if insufficient BMDs are available, hand marked paper ballots should be used.

Here are the finalists for video of the year, which were announced Monday (Oct. 12): Carrie Underwood, “Drinking Alone” Keith Urban, “Polaroid” Kelsea Ballerini, “homecoming queen?” Luke Combs, “Beer Never Broke My Heart” Miranda Lambert, “Bluebird” Tanya Tucker, “Bring My Flowers Now” Combs performed “Beer Never Broke My Heart” on last year’s CMT Music Awards. (See video below.) Lambert’s “Bluebird” is also in the running for video of the year at the 54th annual Country Music Awards. The CMA Awards will be presented on Nov. 11. Here are the eight semifinalists for video of the year at the CMT Music Awards that did not advance to the finals: Ashley McBryde, “One Night Standards”; Blanco Brown, “The Git Up”; Dan + Shay, “I Should Probably Go to Bed”; Little Big Town, “Sugar Coat”; Old Dominion, “Some People Do”; Sam Hunt, “Hard to Forget”; The Chicks, “Gaslighter”; and Thomas Rhett, “Remember You Young.” Rhett won video of the year for “Remember You Young” at the long-delayed Academy of Country Music Awards on Sept. 16. Little Big Town’s video was nominated in that category. Three of the acts that failed to move up at the CMT Music Awards — McBryde, Dan + Shay and Little Big Town — are slated to perform on the show, which will air Oct. 21 at 8 p.m. ET on CMT, MTV, MTV2, Logo, Paramount Network, Pop and TV Land. Kane Brown and actress Sarah Hyland are set to co-host this year’s show, alongside two others to be revealed closer to air date. Brown will also perform on the show, as will Luke Bryan, Maren Morris and more artists to be announced. In addition, Caylee Hammack, HARDY, Ingrid Andress, Mickey Guyton, Riley Green and Travis Denning will make their debuts on the Ram Trucks Side Stage. Voting for video of the year will remain open until the show is in progress. Fans can vote at vote.cmt.com.

Matching the rhetoric Trump is famous for, his choice of words well suited to his disavowal of the blame game centred round White Supremacy, a penalty kick he would inevitably incur in the play ahead of him. In Sri Lanka, the controversial 20A has many shafts from different groups aimed at it, however, with no fatal certainty. The “standby” dictum pronounced by President GR looks a similar side-tracking. The indication is ‘no give and take’ come what may! It appears that the Government is hell bound towards a goal best known to it with least regard to the concerns expressed not only by rival political groups but deflecting even their ardent supporters and promulgators. To the independent onlookers this confrontational approach has become a worrying factor as to why things could not have been dealt with more harmoniously, causing less friction. In such a context the constitutional tangle has to be perceived and focused from a different intersection. Many have come forward opposing 20A totally. Elements politically hostile and inimical obviously have to take this approach because they all played a key frontline role to bring the 19A. But the majority of those MPs now saddled with the responsibility of carrying the 20A through are the same who supported 19A to annul their own 18A passed soon after coming into power in 2010. This group is now reduced to a dilemma in extreme puzzle. Constitutional amendments The 18th Amendment was brought in on 8 September 2010, “to remove the sentence that mentioned the limit of the re-election of the President and to propose the appointment of a parliamentary council that decides the appointment of independent posts like commissioners of election, human rights and Supreme Court Judges.” Ironically, it was a replacement to the 17th Amendment, brought in 2001 ‘to make provisions for the Constitutional Council and Independent Commissions’. Several who supported the 18A in 2010 happen to be the same people who stood up in favour of 17A in 2001. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution was passed by Parliament during the office of Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake and President Chandrika Kumaratunga on 3 October 2001. Several key figures in the current Government were in Parliament then. The 18th Amendment was passed on 8 September 2010 during the Office of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne. Most of the MPs who were in the Parliament when the 17th Amendment was passed subsequently supported its replacement with the 18th Amendment. 19A was passed in Parliament on 28 April 2015 when Maithripala Sirisena was the President and Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister. Parliamentary majority however was with the MPs who were elected to the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was passed by MPs present voting for, except one against, one abstention and 10 absentees. The political party composition of the Parliament when the 19th Amendment was passed was as follows: UPFA headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa: 144 seats UNF headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe: 60 Tamil National Alliance: 14 Democratic National Alliance (JVP): 07 Total: 225 The 19th Amendment could not have been passed without the support of the UPFA majority headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Irony of history The irony of history is, those who voted for 19A then are now clamouring to abolish it. The purpose of 19A was to annul the 18th Amendment which they brought, replacing the 17th. When we look at this hotchpotch situation, we see a total aberration of polarisations and compromising of policies under different leaderships. It is relevant and important to recall a statement made by John Seneviratne MP, on the day of passing the 19th Amendment in Parliament. He said that all those who voted for 18A did not do so because they liked it. But when you are in a government you are compelled to stand by the party they represent. He made a long speech and said that the Government surreptitiously included the removal of executive powers of the President bestowed on him by the Constitution in the bill undermining the people’s sovereignty knowing very well that the Supreme Court would not allow such an amendment without a referendum. He also made reference to the highly-unpalatable position regarding the representative capacity of a MP under the proportionate voting system that was in existence. He stressed that the system did not augur well to provide any meaningful representative right for the voters. This clearly shows that the Ranil/Sirisena minority government had either wooed the Opposition majority to believe that the voting system would be changed in due course or subverted them to surrender under threat of being prosecuted under the pending legal action contemplated against many of them for various alleged wrongdoings during the previous regime. Why the MPs not sitting with the government should have believed and trusted such a promise is a matter beyond anybody’s apprehension. But all MPs who supported the 19A are now trying to use this to rationalise and justify their stand. Historical developments It is interesting to recall the historical developments of the Country’s constitution. The country received autonomy within the British Commonwealth in 1948 as the Dominion of Ceylon. Ceylon had two constitutions, Donoughmore Constitution and the Solbury Constitution. It is the Solbury Constitution that provided a parliamentary form of government for the first time. The Government of Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike set up a joint select committee to consider a revision of the Constitution on 10 January 1958 but this committee could not conclude the matter due to the dissolution of Parliament in 1959. Even the Dudley Senanayake Government that came to power subsequently attempted to bring a new constitution but it was not successful. The only major change in the administration during this period was the abolition of the Upper House, the Senate, in October 1971. Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s United Front Government brought the first major constitutional change by promulgating a Republican Constitution for Sri Lanka in 1972. The National State Assembly so created became the unicameral legislature for the country with a nominal president. In July 1977, this Government was defeated under the leadership of J.R. Jayewardene who secured a five-sixth majority in the State Assembly. A new Constitution drafted by his Government was adopted replacing the 1972 Republican Constitution on 4 October 1977 transforming the nominal president to an executive president. Prime Minister J.R. Jayewardene became the Executive President of Sri Lanka, automatically, on 4 February 1978. This Constitution provided for amendments by a majority of two-thirds in the Parliament barring certain fundamental provisions dealing with important aspects which required an approval at a national referendum in addition to the two-thirds majority in Parliament. This provision remains valid to date. Between the period starting from 20 November 1978 to 17 December 1988, the Constitution of Sri Lanka has undergone 16 amendments, all during the Presidency of J.R. Jayewardene. The most significant amendment was the 13th for the establishment of Provincial Councils on 14 November 1987. Many of the amendments sought to provide strength to the ruler and facilitate his authoritarian rule. We remember how J.R. resorted to obtain undated letters of resignations from his five-sixth MP force while holding the extremely forceful Executive powers denounced by many as highly dictatorial. JR realised that even such an autocratic constitution could not guarantee the uninterrupted continuation of the power base. That is why he resorted to secure the status by keeping the MPs well under his control. But he failed to realise the possibility of the emergence of a future leader who would attempt to hold onto the presidency as long as desired. Bone of contention Matters contended by those challenging the 20A are very much in the public domain now. The present Government was given a mandate by the people to establish a constitution which would address the elimination of all bad experiences of the past. Rushing to bring an amendment which while eliminating certain bad features already identified to exist, simultaneously resurrecting some provisions discarded with much public demand has become a bone of contention. This is where the new Government blundered in stirring up a hornet’s nest. When the public sympathy and support committed to them remained so fresh, why did the Government act with such an undue haste paving the way for huge accusations such as attempting to exercise executive powers without the valve and conduit of the Cabinet? On the part of the citizens of the country (voters) the most important right they wish to be assured to them is the affirmation of the provisions under Article 3 of the Constitution, viz. “in the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise.” In whatever form the Constitution did not intend the president to function as an unfettered repository of executive power unconstrained by the other organs of governance. Before the 19A, the Cabinet of Ministers was charged with the direction and control of the Government of the Republic, which shall be collectively responsible and answerable to Parliament while the President shall be a member of the Cabinet of Ministers and shall be its head. The Constitution also provided that the President shall continue in office notwithstanding the dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers under the provisions of the Constitution. There cannot be any dispute that until such time other provisions are made this state of affairs has to be restored for the operations of the Government to be conducted smoothly with a Cabinet charged with the exercise of Executive power. It is interesting to note that as pointed out by John Seneviratne MP in the Parliament in 2015 before the passing of 19A, Supreme Court held inter-alia, that seven paragraphs in the bill submitted to the Supreme Court require the approval of the People at a Referendum in terms of Article 83 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, we are faced with a situation understandably complicated arisen after the 19A with regard to the Prime Minister exercising powers which are reposed by the people to be exercised by the Executive, namely the President and not the Prime Minister. The Courts held that the President cannot relinquish his executive power and permit it to be exercised by another body or person without his express permission or delegated authority. While these adversities and controversies were identified as requiring immediate correction, there are other issues that have stayed on over a period of time to be addressed in the long term. Independence of the Judiciary, economic development encompassing all sectors of the polity, inclusion of the minorities in the political process assuring equal opportunity, regional autonomy under decentralisation, while maintaining main national structure and unity, and guaranteeing peace and communal harmony are some of those. The country was plagued with the problems devolving round these issues, trying to find solutions under many regimes. The current opportunity given by the people as a clear mandate to put an end to this state of affairs should not be wasted engaged in tinkering and patchwork exercises. A meaningful approach towards finding permanent solutions would receive the public accolade without any hesitation to stand against anybody or any force acting with ulterior motives to sabotage such an approach. Unity of purpose should be the theme of the day to take the country forward from the mess it is now.",unknown,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,https://twonationsoneisland.blogspot.com/2020/10/constitutional-morass-and-standby.html,,,b6ecc83b0d3ac420ed650e4625ae3028,,FALSE,,,,,post,0,,0,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:15.814+0000,,,,,,blog,Blogs,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Blogs,,,BOARDREADER_BLOGS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Email from Q states: Dear Customer: On August 3rd, 2020, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued Q® a formal Cease & Desist letter, notifying us that ATF has taken the position that the Q Honey Badger Pistol is a short-barreled rifle (SBR) regulated under the National Firearms Act (NFA). In response, Q has ceased all production of the Honey Badger Pistol, and submitted a comprehensive letter to ATF and the Department of Justice (DOJ) stating why we disagree with this classification[1]. Additionally, we have provided recommendations on how to address the firearms already in circulation. Q is seeking solutions that best protect you, the individual, and Qs distribution network from falling out of compliance with ATF regulations, and federal law. At this time, Q has not received any definitive guidance from the ATF. In the meantime, Q encourages possessors of the Honey Badger Pistol to take these proactive measures until a resolution is reached between Q and ATF. Complete one of the following: Remove the barreled upper receiver from the lower receiver and dedicate it as a replacement for another AR-style pistol or registered short-barreled rifle; or If you do not possess another AR-style pistol or registered short-barreled rifle, remove the barreled upper receiver from the lower receiver and temporarily transfer it out of your possession by, for example, transferring it to the dominion and control of another individual; and Once the previous step is completed, you may file an ATF Form 1 to register the lower receiver as a short-barreled rifle. Upon Form 1 approval, the firearm may be reassembled. Failure to complete option a or option b could result in prosecution and is subject to a $10,000.00 fine and up to 10 years imprisonment. If you are concerned with this situation - as Q is - we urge you to contact the Department of Justice (ATFs parent agency) by using the below OneClickPolitics link.

(8) In Chapter 7, Section I, subsection 3, first sentence, the words “state or” are repealed. (9) Chapter 8, Section 2, subsection 1, second sentence is amended to read: “One thousand seats shall be allocated to the imperial dominions and the protectorates in proportion to their denizen population”. (10) In Chapter 8, Section 2, subsection 3, the first sentence is repealed. (11) In Chapter 8, Section 3, subsection 1 is amended to read: “The Adelsraad consists of the representatives of the nobility. One-hundred and fifty seats shall be allocated to the imperial dominions according to the proportion of their noble population. An imperial dominion is guaranteed at least one representative.” (12) In Chapter 8, Section 3, subsection 2 is repealed. (13) In Chapter 9, Section B, subsection 2, the words “Imperial States or” are repealed. (14) In Chapter 9, Section B, subsection 3, the words “the State and” are repealed. (15) In Chapter 9, Section C, subsection 1, the words “, Imperial State,” are removed. (16) In Chapter 9, Section C, subsection 7, the words “, Imperial States,” are removed. (17) In Chapter 9, Section E is repealed. The first section is straight forward. It simply changes each state into a dominion, with the same rights, legal systems, etc intact. The second section amends the Charter by removing the references to the states there. States are involved in certain amendments or votes in the Charter and amendments are therefore necessary there. The third section is the most exhaustive one, it removes all references to the states in the Lawbook. Naturally, for this Act to enter force, the Landsraad will need to pass this with 3/4 majority, and no more than 1 state may object to the amendment within one Norton year of the passage.

I missed you. And while The Exchange’s regular columns were off this week (Friday aside, which you can read here), there’s still a hell of a lot to talk about. First, a new website. If you click here, you’ll be taken to a sortable list (spreadsheet? database?) of startups with Black founders. Dubbed The Black Founder List, it’s a great asset and tool. For folks like myself with a research and reporting focus, the list’s sortability of companies founded by Black entrepreneurs by gender, stage and market focus is amazing. And, for investors, it should provide potential dealflow. Do you write lots of Series C checks? The Black Founder List has 23 Series B startups with Black founders. Or if you prefer Series D checks, there are 11 Series C startups with Black founders to check out. Who is writing the most checks to Black founders? Among the top names are M25, a midwest VC group, Techstars Boston and a number of angels. The website was compiled by much the same team that TechCrunch highlighted earlier this year, when their data collection work concerning Black founders was more spreadsheet than app. So, please point your thanks for the new resource to Yonas Beshawred, Sefanit Tades, James Norman and Hans Yadav. The Black Founder List also has a data submission button, so if you notice a missing name, add it. I want the data set to be as robust as possible, as, I reckon, it will prove a great reporting resource. And public data like this obviates certain excuses from the investing class. Market Notes I missed a lot this week that I was looking forward to, including the Asana and Palantir IPOs. For fuller thoughts, head here. Summaries follow: Asana’s direct listing and resulting valuation and implied revenue multiples make its direct listing a win for the company, and the model. If other SaaS companies have the ability to raise ample pre-debut cash, perhaps the direct listing is not as dead as it seemed a few months ago when SPACs stole its spotlight, and most companies were pursuing traditional IPOs regardless. Palantir’s direct listing did not feel hot until it dropped some strong revenue guidance. With that, its direct listing went fine despite its cosmically comedic voting structure. Watching Palantir’s higher-ups try to snuff public input while still providing a thin patina of democracy made me think more about Russia or Texas than a functioning democratic system. Looking ahead, Airbnb is said to be hunting up $3 billion for its own IPO. Airbnb had to take on a lot of expensive cash when its business collapsed in the early COVID days. It wanted to direct list. Now it’s going to cash in a huge pile during its debut. Good. More capital > less capital. Sticking to our late-stage theme, when I left, Root was said to be pursuing an IPO, and when I came back, Roblox is now also tipped to be plotting with the public markets. (Root’s IPO in the wake of the successful Lemonade debut made sense. Insurtech is hot.) The news should not be a surprise; Roblox’s model has found cachet with young gamers and has found a great way to make money at the same time. With a mix of Legos and video game design and Minecraft, perhaps it’s not a surprise that the company is doing well. Reuters reports that Roblox could be worth $4 billion when it goes public. I believe it. Datto is going public. Ron and Danny have the details here. And I chatted with a few Accel investors, the juicy bits from which you can find here. Various and Sundry Draper Esprit, a Europe-focused venture capital fund that trades on the London Stock Exchange, raised £110 million this week. Esprit is a fun shop to track (I’ve known its denizen James since his LSE days), because it’s more transparent than most VC firms than you’re familiar with thanks to its structure. According to the firm’s release, its share sale was “oversubscribed.” Tech.eu has more. Mobile app spend grew to $29.3 billion in Q3, driven by 36.5 billion installs, per SensorTower. Revenue was up 32% year-over-year. Uber sold $500 million worth of Uber Freight to a PE firm. As noted, tech stocks had a bad September, but just how bad might surprise you. And I covered Noyo’s Series A before I left, with the post going up on Monday. In short, Noyo is doing the hard work to build APIs to connect the world of health insurance. It’s a huge, hard task. The $12.5 million was “led by Costanoa Ventures and Spark Capital. Prior investors Core Innovation Capital, Garuda Ventures, the Webb Investment Network, Precursor Ventures and Homebrew upped their investment in the new round.” (I can’t shake the thought that there’s something in the middle of the no-code/low-code boom, and startups delivering more of their products via APIs instead of as managed services. And please don’t say mashups, we left that phrase behind ages ago.) I missed the window for officially commenting on the Coinbase culture dustup — the Equity crew did talk about it while I was AFK — so I will merely share this thread as my $0.02. Also, read this from Eileen Burbidge on TechCrunch concerning the same matter. It’s good. Regular morning Exchange columns return Monday morning. It’s good to be back. By the way, TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility is coming up next week. I am going! To help you get there, here’s a 50% off code for you to get full access to the event.

Golaknath vs State of Punjab - amendment is a law Article 13(2) of Constitution and if it violates any fundamental rights is void (Page 1) — constitutional laws — Supreme Court Judgments & case laws in India,http://www.legalservicesindia.com/forum/post243.html,legalservicesindia.com,neutral,forum,en,IND,ASIA,Asia,India,,,2023-03-02T14:47:15.670+0000,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,0,0,,0,,,"Broadly speaking amendments can be made by four methods (i) by ordinary legislative process with or without restrictions, (ii) by the people through, referendum, (iii) by majority of all the units of a federal State; and (iv) by a special convention. The first method can be in four different ways, namely, (i) by the ordinary course of legislation by absolute majority or by special majority, (See Section 92 (1 )- of the British North America Act, sub-section 152 South African Apt, where under except sections 35, 137 and 152, other provisions could be amended by ordinary legislative process by absolute majority. Many constitutions provide for special majorities.); (ii) by a fixed quorum of members for the consideration of the proposed amendment and a special majority for its passage; (see the defunct Constitution of Rumania), (iii) by dissolution and general election on a particular issue; (see the Constitutions of Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Norway), and (iv) by a majority of two Houses of Parliament in joint session as in the Constitution of the South Africa. The second method demands a popular vote, referendum , or plebiscite as in Switzerland, Australia, Ireland, Italy, France and Denmark. The third method is by an agreement in some form or other of either of the majority or of all the federating units as in Switzerland, Australia and the United States of America. The fourth method is generally by creation of a special body ad hoc for the purpose of constitution revision as in Latin America. Lastly, some constitutions impose express limitation on the power to amend. (See Art. 5 of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the Fourth French Republic). A more elaborate discussion of this topic may be found in the American political Constitution by Strong. It will, therefore, be seen that the power to amend and the procedure to amend radically-differ from State to State; it is left to the constitution-makers to prescribe the scope of the power and the method of amendment having regard to the requirements of the particular State. There is no article in any of the constitutions referred to us similar to article 13(2) of our Constitution. India adopted a different system altogether: it empowered the Parliament to amend the Constitution by the legislative process subject to fundamental rights. The Indian 1 Constitution has made the amending process comparatively flexible, but it is made subject to fundamental rights. Now let us consider the argument that the power to amend is a sovereign power, that the said power is supreme to the legislative power, that it does not permit any implied limitations and that amendments made in exercise of that power involve political questions and that, therefore, they are outside judicial review, This wide proposition is sought to be supported on the basis of opinions of jurists and judicial decisions. Long extracts have been read to us from the book ""The Amending of the Federal Constitution (1942)"" by Lester Bernhardt Orfield, and particular reference was made to the following passages : ""At the point it may be well to note that when the Congress is engaged in the amending process it is not legislating. It is exercising a peculiar power bestowed upon it by Article Five. This Article for the most part ,controls the process; and other provisions of the Constitution, such as those relating to the passage of legislation, having but little bearing."" Adverting to the Bill of Rights, the learned author remarks that they may be repealed just as any other amendment and that they are no more sacred from a legal standpoint than any other part of the Constitution. Dealing with the doctrine of implied limitations, he says that it is clearly untenable. Posing the question 'Is other a law about the amending power of the Constitution ?"", he answers, ""there is none"". He would even go to the extent of saying that the sovereignty, if it can be said to exist at all, is located in the amending body. The author is certainly a strong advocate of the supremacy of the amending power and an opponent of the doctrine of implied limitations. His opinion is based upon the terms of Art. 5 of the Constitution of the United States of America and his interpretation of the decisions of the Supreme Court of America. Even such an extreme exponent of the doctrine does not say that a particular constitution cannot expressly impore restrictions on the power to amend or that a court cannot reconcile the articles couched in unlimited phraseology. Indeed Art. 5 of the American Constitution imposes express limitations on the amending power. Some passages from the book ""Political Science and Government"" by James Wilford Garner are cited. Garner points out : ""An unamendable constitution, said Mulford, is the &&worst tyranny of time, or rather the very tyranny of time"" But he also notices ""The provision for amendment should be neither so rigid as to make needed changes practically impossible nor so flexible as to encourage frequent and unnecessary changes and thereby lower the authority of the Constitution."" Munro in his book ""The Government of the United States"", 5th Edition, uses strong words when he says ""....... it is impossible to conceive of an unamendable constitution as anything but a contradiction in terms."" The learned author says that such a constitution would constitute ""government by the graveyards."" Hugh Evander Wills in his book ""Constitutional Law of the United States"" avers that the doctrine of amendability of the Constitution is grounded in the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people and that it has no such implied limitations as that an amendment shall not contain a new grant of power or change the dual form of government or change the protection of the Bill of Rights, or make any other change in the Constitution. Herman Finer in his book ""The Theory and Practice of Modem Government"" defines ""constitution"" as its process of amendment, for, in his view, to amend is to deconstitute and reconstitute. The learned author concludes that the amending clause is so fundamental to a constitution that he is tempted to call it the constitution itself. But the learned author recognizes that difficulty in amendment certainly products circumstances and makes impossible the surreptitious abrogation of rights guaranteed in the constitution. William S. Livingston in ""Federalism and Constitutional Change"" says : ""The formal procedure of amendment is of greater importance than the informal processes, because it constitutes a higher authority to which appeal lies on any question that may arise."" But there are equally eminent authors who express a different view. In ""American Jurisprudence"", 2nd Edition, Vol. 16, it is stated that a statute and a constitution though of unequal dignity are both laws. Another calls the constitution of a State as one of the laws of the State. Cooley in his book on ""Constitutional Law"" opines that changes in the fundamental laws of the State must be indicated by the people themselves. He further implies limitations to the amending power from the belief in the constitution itself, such as, the republican form of Government cannot be abolished as it would be revolutionary in ifs characters. In the same book it is further said that the power to amend the constitution by legislative action does not confer the power to break it any more than it confers the power to legislate on any other subject contrary to the prohibitions. C. F. Strong in his book ""Modem Poliical Constitutions"", 1963 edition, does not accept the theory of absolute sovereignty of the amending power which does not brook any limitations, for he says. 802 ""In short, it attempts to arrange for the recreation of a constituent assembly whenever such matters are in future to be considered, even though that assembly be nothing more than the ordinary legislature acting under certain restrictions. At the same time, there may be some elements of the constitution which the constituent assembly wants to remain unalterable by the action of any authority whatsoever. These elements are to be distinguished from the rest, and generally come under the heading of fundamental law. Thus, for example, the American Constitution, the oldest of the existing Constitutions, asserts that by no process of amendment shall any State, without its own consent, be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate, , while among the Constitutions more recently promulgated, those of the Republics of; France and Italy, each containing a clause stating that the republican form of government cannot be the subject of an amending proposals"" it is not necessary to multiply citations from text-books. A catena of American decisions have been cited before us in support of the contention that the unending power is a supreme power or that it involves political issues which are not justiciable. It would be futile to consider them. at length, for after going through them carefully we find that there are no considered judgments of the American Courts, which would have a persuasive effect in that regard. In the Constitution of the United States of America, prepared by Edwards S. Corwin, Legislative Reference Service, Library of Congress, (1953 edn.), the following summary under the heading ""Judicial Review under Article V"" is given : ""Prior to 1939, the Supreme Court had taken cognizance of a number of diverse objections to the validity of specific amendments. Apart from holding that official notice of ratification by the several States was con- clusive upon the Courts, it had treated these questions as justiciable, although it had uniformly rejected them on the merits. In that year, however, the whole subject was thrown into confusion by the inconclusive decision in Coleman v. Miller. This case came up on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kansas to review the denial of a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of the Kansas Senate to erase an endorsement on a resolution ratifying the child labour amendment to the Constitution to re- effect that it had been adopted by the Kansas Senate. The attempted ratification was assailed on three grounds : (1) that the amendment had been previously rejected by the State Legislature; (2) that it was no longer open to ratification because an unreasonable period of time thirteen years, had elapsed since its submission to the States, and (3) that the lieutenant governor had no right to cast the deciding vote in the Senate in favour of ratification. Four opinions were written in the Supreme Court, no one of which commanded the support of more than four mem- bers of the Court. The majority ruled that the plain-tiffs, members of the Kansas State Senate, had a sufficient interest in the controversy to give the federal courts jurisdiction to review the case. Without agreement as to the grounds for their decision, a different majority affirmed the judgment of the Kansas court denying the relief sought. Four members who concur-red in the result had voted to dismiss the writ on the ground that the amending process ""is political"" in its. entirety, from submission until an amendment becomes part of the Constitution, and is not subject to judicial guidance, control or interference at any point."" whether the contention that the lieutenant governor should have been permitted to cast the deciding vote in favour of ratification presented a justiciable controversy was left undecided, the court being equally divided on the point. In an opinion reported as ""the opinion of the Court""' but in which it appears that only three Justices concurred, Chief Justice Hughes declared that the writ of' mandamus was properly denied because the question as to the effect of the previous rejection of the amendment and the lapse of time since it was submitted to the States were political questions which should be left to Congress. On the same day, the Court dismissed a. writ of certiorari to review a decision 'of the Kentucky Court of Appeals declaring the action of the Kentucky General Assembly purporting to ratifying the child labour amendment illegal and void. Inasmuch as the governor had forwarded the certified copy of the resolution to the Secretary of State before being served with a copy of the restraining order issued by the State Court, the Supreme Court found that there 'was no longer a controversy susceptible of judicial determination."" This passage, in our view, correctly summarises the American law on the subject. It will be clear therefrom that prior to 1939 the Supreme Court of America had treated the objections to the validity of specific amendments as justiciable and that only in 1939 it rejected them in an inconclusive judgment without discussion. In this state of affairs we cannot usefully draw much from the judicial wisdom of the Judges of the Supreme Court of America. One need not cavil at the description of an amending power as sovereign power, for it is sovereign only within the scope of the power conferred by a particular constitution. All the authors also agree, that a particular constitution can expressly limit the power of amendment, both substantive and procedural. The only conflict lies in the fact that some authors do not pen-nit implied limitations when the power of amendment is expressed in general words. But others countenance such limitations by construction or otherwise. But none of the authors goes to the extent of saying, which is the problem before us, that when there are conflicting articles couched in widest terms, the court has no jurisdiction to construe and harmonize them. If some of the authors meant to say that-in our view, they did not-we cannot agree with them, for, in that event this Court would not be discharging its duty. Nor can we appreciate the arguments repeated before us by learned counsel for the respondents that the amending process involves political questions which are, outside the scope of judicial review. When a matter comes before the Court, its jurisdiction does not depend upon the nature of the question raised but on die, question whether the said matter is expressly or by necesssary implication excluded from its jurisdiction. Secondly, it is not possible to define what is a political question and what is not. The character of a question depends upon the circumstances and the nature of a political society. To put if differently, the court does not decide any political question at all in the ordinary sense of the. term, but only ascertains whether Parliament is acting within the scope of the amending power. It may be that Parliament seeks to amend the Constitution for political reasons, but the Court in denying that power will not be deciding on political questions, but will only be holding that Parliament has no power to amend particular articles of the Constitution for any purpose whatsoever, be it political or otherwise. We, therefore, hold that there is nothing in the nature of the amending power which enables Parliament to override all the express or implied limi- tations imposed on that power. As we have pointed out earlier, our Constitution adopted a novel method in the sense that Parliament makes the amendment by legislative process subject to certain restrictions and,that the amendment so made being law"" is.subject to Art. 13(2). The next argument is based upon the expression ""amendment"" in Art. 368 of the Constitution and if is contended that the said power but of constituent Dower and, therefore, an amendment of the Constitution is not law at all as contemplated by Art. 13(2). I. am reminded of the. words of. Justice Holmes that ""we ,must think- things and not words"". The true principle is that if there are two provisions in the Constitution which seem to be hostile, juridical hermeneutics requires the Court to interpret them by combining them and not by destroying one with the aid of the other. No part in a Constitution is superior to another part unless the Constitution itself says so and there is no accession 'of strength to any provision by calling it a code. Portalis, the great. French Jurist .(who helped in the making of the Code Napole on) supplied the correct principle when he said that it is the context of the legal provisions which serves to illustrate the meaning. of the different parts, so that among them and between them there should be correspondence and harmony. We have two provisions to reconcile. Article 368 which says that the Constitution may be amended by, following this and this. procedure, and Art. 13(2) which says, the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III and that any law made in contravention of the clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void. The question, therefore, is : does- this create any limitation upon the amending process ? On the answer to this question depends the solution of all the problems in this case. It is an error to view our Constitution as if it were a mere organisational document by which the people established the atructure and the mechanism of their Government. Our Constitution is intended to be much more because it aims at being a social document In which the relationship of society to the indiVidual and of Government to both and the rights of the minorities and the backward classes are clearly laid down. This social document is headed by a Preamble* which epitomizes the principles on which the Government is intended to function and these principles are later expanded into Fundamental Rights in Part III and the Directive Principles of Policy in Part TV. The former 'are protected but the latter are not. The former represent the ""PREAMBLE WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA having solemnly Resolved to .constitute India into a SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure all Its citizens: JUSTICE, social, economic and political; EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them.all FRATERNITY assuring the, dignity of the individual and.the unity of Nation: IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November,1949,do HEREBY ADOPT,ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTffUTION."" 859 limits of State action and the latter are the obligations and the duties of the Government as a good and social Government. Why was it necessary to have the Fundamental Rights at all and make them justiciable ? As we seem to be forgetting our own history so soon let me say that the answer lies there the Nationalist Movement and the birth of the Indian National Congm in 1885 were the direct result of the discriminatory treatment of the Indians in their own country. The demand for the guarantee of Fundamental Rights had unfortunately to be made. then to a foreign ruler and it appeared in the Constitution of India Bill framed by the Indian National Congress ten years later. All that is valuable to an Individual in civilized society, including free speech, imprisonment only by a competent authority, free law education, etc. were claimed therein. Resolutions of the Congress since then reiterated this demand and the securing of Fundamental Rights in any future Constitution became one of the articles of faith. To cut the narration short, the main steps may only be mentioned. Mrs. Besant's Commonwealth of India Bill 1925 with its seven fundamental rights (the precursor of Art. 19), the Madras Congress Resolution of 1927--""a constitution on the basis of declaration of rights""-- the Nehru Report--it is obviour, that our first care should be to have the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in a manner which will not permit their withdrawal in any circumstancees--, the draft article in the Nehru Constitution ""No person shall be deprived of his liberty, nor shall his dwelling or property be entered, requisitioned or confiscated save in accordance with law""-, the Independence Resolution of 26th January, 1930--We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth"" the Karachi Resolution on Fundamental Rights, Economic and Social Change (1931), the Sapru Report (1945) which for the first time distinguished between justiciable and non- ,justiciable rights, the Suggestion of the Cabinet Mission for the constitution of an Advisory Committee on Fundamental and Minority Rights, and, lastly the Committee on Fundamental Rights of the Constituent Assembly, are just a few of the steps to be remembered. The Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles were the result. Fundamental laws are needed to make a Government of laws and not of men and the Directive Principles are needed to lay down the objectives of a good Government. Our Constitution was not the cause but the result of political and personal freedom"". Since Dicey had said that ""the proclamation . in a Constitution or Charter of the right to personal freedom, or indeed of any other right, gives of itself but slight security that the right has more than a 860 nominal existence"",(1) provision had to be made for guaranteeing them andto make them justiciable and enforceable. This result is reachedby means of Arts. 12, 13, 32, 136, 141, 144 and 226. The The High Courts and finally this Court have been made the Judges of whether any legislative or executive action on the part oft the State considered as comprehensively as is possible, offends the Fundamental Rights and Art. 13(2) declares that legislation which so offends is to be deemed to be void. It is thus that Parliament cannot today abridge or take away a single Fundamental Right even by a 'unanimous vote in both the Chambers. But on the argument of the State it has only 'to change the title of the same Act to an Amendment of the Constitution Act and then a majority of the total strength and a 2/3rds majority of the members present and voting in each House may remove not only any of the Fundamental Rights, but the whole Chapter giving them. And this is said to be possible because of Art. 368 and its general language which, it is claimed, makes no exception in its text and, therefore, no exception can be implied. It is obvious that if an Act amending the Constitution is- treated as a law it must also be subject to the provisions of Art. 13(2). Since the definition of the word 'law', makes no exception a strenuous eeffort is made on the basis of argument and authority to establish that a constituent power does not result in a law in the ordinary sense. Distinction is thus made between laws made ordinarily that is to say, from day to day by ordinary majority and laws made occasionally for the amendment of the Constitution by a slightly enhanced majority. In our Constitution this distinction is not valid in the eye of Art. 13(2). It is not essential,, of course, that a difference must always exist in the procedure for the exercise of constituent and ordinary, legislative power. One has not to go far to find the example of a country in which constitutional law as such may be made by the same agency which makes ordinary laws. The most outstanding, example is that of England about which de Tocqueville observed. ""the Parliament has an acknowledged right to modify the Constitution; as, therefore, the Constitution may undergo perpetual changes, it does not in reality exist; the Parliament is at once a legislative and a constituent assembly:""(2) of course, the dictum of de Tocqueville that the English Constitution ""elle n'existe point"" (it does not exist) is far from accu- (1)Dicey: ""Law of the Constitution"" 10th Edn. p. 207. (2)Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution A.V. Dicey Tenth Edn p. 88 quoting from OEuvres completes (14th ed.,1864) (Democratie en Amerique), pp. 166, 167. 861 rate. There is a vast body of constitutional laws in England which is written and statutory but it is not all found in one place and arranged as a written Constitution usually is. The Act of Settlement (1701), the Act of Union with Scotland (1707), the Act of Union with Ireland (1800) the Parliament Act (1911) the Representation of the Peoples Acts of 1832, 1867, 1884, 1918, 1928 and 1948, the Ballot Act (1872), the Judicature Acts 1873, 1875 and 1925, the Incitement to Disaffection Act (1934), His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act (1936), the Regency Act (1937) and the various Acts setting up different ministries are examples of what will pass for constitutional law under our system(1). The Bill of Rights (1689) lays down the fundamental rule in England that taxation may not be levied without the consent of Parliament which in our Constitution has its counterpart in Art. 265. In our Constitution also the laws relating to delimitation of constituencies or allotment of seats to such constituencies made or purporting to be made under Art. 327 or Art. 328, by reason of the exclusion of the powers of the courts to question them, are rendered constitutional instruments. Other examples of constitutions which, in addition to constitution proper, contain certain ordinary legislation, having constitutional qualities, also exist. (2) What then is the real distinction between ordinary law and the law made in the exercise of constituent power? I would say under the scheme of our Constitution none at all. This distinction has been attempted to be worked out by several authors. It is not necessary to quote them. Taking the results obtained by Willoughby(3) it may be said that the fact that a Constitution is written as a Constitution is no distinction because in Britain constitutional law is of both kinds and both parts coexist. The test that the Constitution requires a different kind of procedure for amendment, also fails because in Britain Parliament by a simple majority makes laws and also amends constitutional statutes. In our Constitution too, in spite of the claim that Art. 368 is a code (whatever is meant by the word ,code, here), Arts. 4, 11 and 169 show that the amendment of the Constitution can be by the ordinary law making procedure. By this method one of the legislative limbs in a State can be removed or created. 'This destroys at one stroke the claim that Art. 368 is a code arid also that any special method of amendment of the Constitution is fundamentally necessary. (1) The list is raken from K. C. Wheare's: ""The Statute of Westminster and Dominion Status"" (4th Edn) p. 8. Dicey and others give different list. (2) See Constitutions of Austria, Honduras, Nicaragua Peru, Spain and Sweden among others. The Constitution of Spain, in particular is in several Instruments. The Constitution of Austria (A-t. 149) makes special mention of these constitutional instruments. (3) Tagore Law Lectures (1924) p. 83. 862 The next test that the courts must apply the Constitution in preference to the ordinary law may also be rejected on the ansalogy of the British practice. There, every statute has equal standing. Therefore, the only difference can be said to arise from the fact that.constitutional laws are generally amendable under a process which in varying degrees, is more difficult or elaborate. This may give a distinct character to the law of the Constitution but it does not serve to distinguish it from the other laws of the land for purposes of Art. 13(2). Another difference is that in the written constitutions the form and power of Government alone are to be found and not rules of private law as is the case with ordinary laws. But this is also not an invariable rule. The Ame Constitution and our Constitution itself are outstanding examples There are certain other differences of degree, such as that nary _legislation may be tentative or temporary, more detailed or secondary, while the Constitution is intended to be permanent, general and primary. Because it creates limitations on the ordinary legislative power, constitutional law in a sense is fundamental law, but if the legislative and constituent processes can become one, Ls there any reason why the result should be regarded as law in the one case and not in the other ? On the whole, therefore, as observed in the American Jurisprudence ""It should be noticed however that a statute and a constitution, though of unequal dignity are both laws and each rests on the will of the people........"" A Constitution is law which is intended to be, for all time and is difficult to change so that it may not be subject to ""impulses ofmajority"" ""temporary excitement and popular caprice or passion""(2). I agree with the authors cited before us that the power of amendment must be possessed by the State. I do not take a narrow view of the word ""amendment"" as including only minor changes within the general framework. By an amendment new matter may be added, old matter removed or altered. I alm concede that the reason for the amendment of the Constitution is a political matter although I do not go as far as some Justice of the Supreme court of the United States did in Coleman v. Miller(3) that the whole process is ""political in its entirely from submission until an Amendment becomes part of the Constitution and is not subject to judicial guidance, control or interference at any point."" There are fundamental differences between our Con- (1) American Jurispruence Vol. II Section 3.

Indeed this: dictum of the four Justices based upon, the case of Luther v. Borden(1) has lost some of its force after Baker v. Carr(2) A Republic must, as says Story, (8) possess the means for altering and improving the fabric of the Government so as, to promote the happiness and safety of the people. The power is also needed to disarm opposition and prevent factions over the Constitution. The power, however, is not intended to be used for experiments or as an escape from restrictions against undue state action enacted in the Constitution itself. Nor %'LS the power of amendment available for the purpose of removing express or fmplied restrictions against the State. Here I make a difference between Government and State which I shall explain presently. As Willoughby(4) points out constitutional law ordinarily limits Government but not the State because a constitutional law is the creation of the State for its own purpose. But there is nothing to prevent the State from limiting itself. The rights and duties of the individual and the manner in which such rights are to be exercised and enforced ;ire ordinarily to be found in the laws though some of the Constitutions also fix them. It is now customary to have such rights guaranteed in the Constitution. Peaslee,(5) writing in 1956 says that about 88% of the national Constitutions contain clauses respecting individual liberty and fair legal process; 83% respecting freedom of speech and the press; 82% respecting property right; 80% respecting rights of assembly and association; 80% respecting rights of conscience and religion; 79% res- pecting secrecy of correspondence and inviolability of domi- cile; 78% respecting education; 73% respecting equality 64% respecting right to petition; 56% respecting labour; 51% respecting social security; 47% respecting rights of movement within, and to and from the nation; 47% respecting health and motherhood; and 35% respecting the non- retroactivity of laws. In some of the Constitutions there is an attempt to put a restriction against the State seeking to whittle down the rights conferred on the individual. Our Constitution is the most outstanding example of this restriction which is to be found in Art. 13(2).

Here is a related item. Christian Dominionism (this is basically the philosophical underpinnings for Christian Nationalism). This Theology hold that it is a responsibility of Christians to control the government and the work place in order to enforce Christianity through these positions. This started as a somewhat organized effort in the mid 1970's and found the GOP to be a useful tool. Basically the GOP decided to court evangelicals thinking they could control them as a large voting block. It backfired and the evangelicals now control the GOP. I have compiled some articles below which are useful. They provide information on why and how this has come to be. I tried to locate information from a variety of sources and not just atheist or humanist portals or organizations. I even have one from the Anchorage Daily News.

I'm too lazy to google release dates, but probably give edge to anything released later in 2021 due to relaxing anxiety. Kids movies probably going to do better than usually too as they are going stir crazy.

Just gotta be careful not to pull an Umbrella Academy and get stuck there! 4. Upon joining Remnants of Hope you are expected to maintain a mature and friendly demeanor to everyone in game. What does maturity mean to you and do you feel that you can remain civil even with the nastiest players in the game? Maturity to me is respect, even if you disagree. I find that respect (or lack thereof) is often the key to conflict. That said, if someone isn't showing me the same, I find it's best to ignore them and escalate the issue if there someone who can help mediate and resolve the problem. Yes. RoH was great when I was a member a few years ago. Super helpful, loved that there was something going on all the time. Or, if I had something I was working on, there were people willing to help! I was also an Officer in a WoW guild back in the day. Iron Clad Gathering, though I don't think they're still around. I didn't like the lack of leadership at the top, and they didn't stick to their raid guidelines. I have - an Officer in a WoW guild. Not this time, I'd rather stick to being a casual player, helping people when I can, and enjoying the game as a follower. Patience and discipline, on both sides. I'm a patient person, but it can get out of hand and I occasionally allow people to let things carry on for too long. Similarly, discipline. I can be very disciplined about some things, and not others. I'm currently struggling with self-discipline in NC's quarantine. I've been getting up later, feel like I'm less productive, and need some discipline to get back on track. PvE, though I'm getting into PvP a bit more. Crafting is cool, but takes WAY too long in my opinion. I'm only now starting to ramp up my crafting to get a legendary. I feel like social is a given for me. I enjoy playing the game, and interacting with those who have similar in-game interests. I'd love to learn better tactics for PvP and have someone to lose with! :-P Oh boo! Figure out who in the game plays Destiny and see if they want to start a RoH clan on there. Destiny is my other game vice, and I play with some college buddies. It's about sharing what I love, and if there are others I enjoy playing GW2 with, why not carry that over into another game? Similarly, if there's another game others LOVE, I now have a great excuse to check it out. Destiny, as I mentioned above. I play with some college friends, which makes it a great way to stay in touch. Civ 6 - my fiancee and I play when we want a quiet game night at home. I love the beginning of Civ games, exploration and figuring out how I'm going to win. They occasionally get boring mid-to-late game. It's the build up and exploration that's fun. And since you didn't specify - I'm also a fan of 7 Wonders and Dominion. They're great board games, and if you haven't tried them...DO IT! I recently saw a question on Reddit...""Why have Hydras never thought to bit their own head off so two will grow in its place?"" So maybe a hydra to test that theory?

There were things I needed to accomplish. There were specialized certificates I had to acquire and black pants to find for my new work uniform. There was a bit of this and a bit of that, all to ensure that my return to the workforce would go as smoothly as possible. Despite these preparations, until the start date, I still have some of the excess of time I have had for the last 6 months. I still have the time to observe, in detail, the events going on in the U.S., often at break neck speed. A legendary woman, her contribution to our nation virtually incalculable, sadly passes away. Within hours of the announcement of her death the political carrion known as the Republican Party are vowing to replace her despite a highly contentious election being held just weeks away, early and absentee voting already underway. The final Supreme Court nominee of the previous administration was put on hold for 8 months by the Republicans. A woman is shot 6 times in her bed yet none of the police officers involved are charged with her death. Only one is charged, with reckless endangerment for the shots that penetrated adjacent apartments, not for the shots that penetrated the body of the dead woman. Protesters, the great majority of them peaceful, once again pour into the streets of cities across the nation. All the while a dangerous, childish president, who we learn has attempted to turn tax avoidance into a fine art, states he will not guarantee a peaceful transition of power while attempting to throw into question the legitimacy of the upcoming election. Lest we forget, a pandemic is still raging across the country and 850,00 new people file for unemployment each week. During these abnormal times people are longing for normal. Some states open up exacerbating the risk of new infections and deaths as a result of complications of the virus. Citizens, never adequately protected financially by the government for the necessary shut down, teeter on the edge of poverty and homelessness. Mask wearing, a proven deterrent to transmission of the virus becomes a political hot potato. People rail about their rights yet have no issue with trampling on others right to dominion over their own bodies. They wish to legally censure people for who they love. They moan about the lack of morals in the country today, yet do not show the simple human concern to wear a mask to protect others. I do not know how it will end. I try to remain optimistic. I remind myself that, according to polls, a majority of my fellow citizens still cling to the values of decency, truthfulness and the acceptance and worth of others.

The poll books are used to check voter registration at polling sites and were partially responsible for voting difficulties in some districts in Georgia during the June primaries. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg, who was nominated by former President Obama, ruled that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) must immediately send paper formats of all the information contained in electronic poll books and require election officials to use this paper backup in the case of a machine malfunction. Totenberg also ordered Raffensperger to ensure that emergency paper ballots are available at precincts to ensure Georgia voters can cast a ballot in the case of a malfunction, and additionally to ensure election officials are trained in how to handle both paper poll books and emergency ballots. “The narrowly tailored relief ordered directs that the State Defendants provide at least a modicum of the voting backup plan tools essential to protecting voters’ constitutionally protected ability and right to cast a ballot that is counted and given the same weight as any other on this coming November 3rd general election day and thereafter,” Totenberg wrote in the 67-page order. Totenberg noted that “it is not too late” for state officials to “take these reasonable concrete measures to mitigate the real potential harms that would otherwise likely transpire at precinct polling locations grappling with the boiling brew created by the combination of new voting equipment issues and old voter data system deficiencies.” The Associated Press reported that Raffensperger plans to appeal the ruling. Raffensperger stated that his office and election officials “are preparing Georgia for the biggest election turnout in history, and it will do so successfully despite the constant distraction of litigation filed by activists determined to undermine the credibility of our elections.” The ruling comes after voters in some precincts in Georgia were forced to wait in line for hours during the June primary elections due to a smaller amount of polling locations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as issues with polling pads. The state awarded a $107 million contract to Dominion Voting Systems to implement a “verified paper ballot system” following a previous ruling from Totenberg last year that required state officials to phase out paperless voting machines ahead of the 2020 elections in order to increase election security. Dominion’s KnowInk PollPads are the equipment the order applies to, with Dominion providing technical support to election officials using its equipment during elections. The plaintiffs — made up of a coalition of voting rights advocates — cited multiple incidents with the poll books during both the June 9 and August 11 Georgia elections in asking Totenberg to require backup paper poll books, with voters in some cases sent to different polling locations or being denied a ballot due to poll book issues. The Coalition for Good Governance, one of the plaintiffs in the case, tweeted its support for Totenberg’s ruling on Monday, noting that “updated paper backup poll books in every precinct is a simple solution that will help prevent long lines caused by check in delays and potential errors from electronic poll books.” Totenberg noted in the order on Monday that the ruling on backup paper pollbooks was meant to be a portion of a larger case brought by the plaintiffs targeting voting machines in the state. Totenberg wrote that due to new evidence submitted by the voting rights plaintiffs last week, the larger ruling was delayed, and the narrower ruling was rolled out to “avoid delay” and give state officials time to implement the ordered measures ahead of Election Day. The Coalition for Good Governance on Friday filed a court document alleging that there is a serious error in Georgia voting databases, citing a message sent by a Georgia state election official to counties warning of the error and noting that the error would require “every county to get a new database” prior to Election Day. Totenberg wrote Monday that “the relief that the Coalition Plaintiffs seek here is a limited common sense remedy to the real and repetitive voting impediments Plaintiffs have experienced at the precinct threshold and the substantial threat that they will face from these impediments anew in the 2020 general election if preliminary injunctive relief is not granted.”

And it will have to be widespread. So be careful. ‘ “And we want a very gentle transition,” he assured. ‘But we don’t want to be cheated and be stupid and say’ Oh let’s switch ‘. Well, we’ll go and we’ll make a transition and we’ll know there were thousands and thousands of ballots that made a difference by cheating. We are not going to stand for it. ‘ The president was forced to confirm that there would be a peaceful transfer of power if Joe Biden wins in November after declining to answer a direct question on the matter at a White House press conference earlier this week. Trump has often spoken out against postal voting as several states have taken steps to send ballots to all registered voters in the midst of the global health crisis. He maintains that the alternative voting option will cause more fraud and disproportionately benefit Democrats. He has also insinuated that the election will not be legitimate if mass mail-in-vote is implemented. “This is a disaster waiting to happen,” Trump said of the email voting. And the only hope we really have, other than we end up having to go through a long, incredible process after it’s over. Because we are going to win. We’re not going to lose this unless they cheat – that’s how I look at it. ‘ Donald Trump said on Friday that the only way he would lose the November election is if Democrats cheat with massive ballot measures. That’s the only way we’ll lose is when there is calamity. And it will have to be widespread. So be careful, ” Trump warned a very loyal crowd at a rally in Newport News, Virginia The president also assured that there would be a ‘very friendly handover of power’ if he lost in November ‘We can’t let them cheat. We cannot allow them – our country is at stake, ‘the president told a roaring crowd. ‘Because these people will destroy our country, we cannot let this happen. And this is a scam. They know, the media knows, but the media don’t want to report it. They know exactly what’s going to happen and so do I. But the Democrats know better than all of us what’s going to happen. ‘ He warned his supporters against harvesting, where those who deliver the ballots try to influence voters in some way, and urged them to report any suspicious activity or potential sabotage. ‘If you see something, you just have to report it and all. We all watch, ”he said. President Trump was asked at a press conference on Wednesday evening whether he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the November election – and declined to do so. “Well, we’ll have to see what happens,” Trump said. It was a similar comment to the one he made in 2016 when he asked similar questions. “Win, lose or draw in this election, are you here today to commit to a peaceful transfer of power after the election?” Trump was asked at the top of his press conference. “Get rid of the ballots and you have a very peaceful one – there will be no transfer, frankly, there will be a continuation,” the president continued, referring likely to the post-in ballots. He continued: “The ballots have gotten out of hand. You know if. And you know who knows better than anyone else, the Democrats, ”he said. This caused many Republican lawmakers to defend US election integrity and ensure that there will be a “peaceful” and “orderly” transition regardless of who the winner is. Biden had no words when asked how he felt about the president’s comments. “What country are we in?” the former vice president asked reporters. “I’m funny,” he clarified. ‘I said, what country are we in? See, he says the most irrational things. I don’t know what to say. ‘ The president made the comment because some of his harshest critics accused him of undertaking authoritarianism. Biden said this summer’s Trump “will try to steal,” but said he is confident the military will “escort him out of the White House with great haste.” Trump visited Virginia the night before announcing who he is nominating to fill the Supreme Court seat released by Ruth Bader Ginsburg with her death last Friday. Thousands with Trump badges gathered Friday night for an open-air meeting on the tarmac of the New News / Williamsburg International Airport in Virginia. The rain lifted before the president arrived, while a brisk wind that welcomed the first week of fall prevailed all night as Trump spoke just 38 days before election day. Many in attendance wore face covers with Trump’s campaign logo or slogan plastered over them, while others did not follow Centers for Disease Control’s recommendations, and some had masks pulled under their chins for the duration of the meeting. The overall theme of the evening? Fill that chair! Crowd members encouraged Trump in the form of blue white-lettered signs and verbal chants to appoint a conservative Supreme Court judge to fill the seat of Liberal Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was vacant by her death last Friday stayed. Earlier in the day, reports emerged that the president will appoint federal judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace Ginsburg, who lied to the Supreme Court and the Capitol this week at rest. Ginsburg died at the age of 87 from complications from pancreatic cancer. Trump has been promoted to take the seat for the election, further suggesting that he will question the outcome in November and expect a possible Supreme Court battle over the eventual winner. By getting his candidate through – an apparently straightforward task with a Republican majority in the Senate – Trump also wants to ensure a conservative majority in the highest U.S. court. Virginia is the southernmost state on the East Coast to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while all other southern states voted red. Trump lost the state by a margin of more than 5 percent, with Clinton earning 49.8 percent compared to his 44.4 percent. Polls in Virginia show that Biden won anywhere from five to 14 percent in November. The president admitted that he didn’t pay much attention to Virginia in 2016, claiming his advisers said it was a lost cause for the left. But after a marginal loss, Trump believes he could win the state of Old Dominion this time around. .

Efram was given command of Iron Legion troops for the assault on the Frost Citadel and nothing else. He does not control the Iron Legion, not even within the whole Drizzlewood theater of war. He only commanded the Iron troops assaulting Frost Citadel. Efram is also very unlikely to be Khan-Ur due to the fact that he is Flame Legion. Most charr do not trust Flame yet - even most of Flame do not trust non-Flame. Efram's goal is peace, not leadership. He only became Imperator of Flame Legion because he was the highest ranking charr who wanted peace and fell into the position. Even then, during Bound by Blood, he wasn't technically the Flame Imperator, just the temporary defacto leader of the Flame vying for peace. There are Flame out there who do not follow Efram (and I don't mean those who joined the Dominion either). It simply wouldn't be realistic for someone who wasn't even an imperator by the beginning of the story to become Khan-Ur of all charr. Besides this, Malice has a much higher degree of credibility than Efram. Most likely, though, there won't be a new Khan-Ur. Firstly, because charr society has existed for over a thousand years without one, despite various attempts to ""crown"" a new Khan-Ur. Secondly, and more importantly, is that the charr side of the Icebrood Saga has a running theme of traditionalists versus progressives. Those who value old charr ideals and charr superiority, and those who value new charr ideals and peace. This divided into Dominion versus United Legions and despite some Dominion calling the United Legions ""old charr"", the Dominion were stuck with values of the past and were far more caught up with concepts as old as the Khan-Ur as Smodur was. The rest of the United Legions aren't caught up in those ideals, and that includes both warring with humans and having a Khan-Ur. I think the ending of the charr will be: Rytlock becomes new Blood Imperator Mia Kindleshot becomes new Iron Imperator Efram declared official Flame Imperator Malice is the only proper candidate but denies Khan-Ur position Now, there was a comment that after Episode 4, there will be updates that are more closely tied to Season 1's system, and this included as an example the vote between Kiel and Gnashblade. Suggesting that the community might be voting for some charr official. I imagine this will be either a) Blood Imperator and/or b) Iron Imperator. Maybe it will include Khan-Ur, but I think they'll keep the charr without a Khan-Ur. If so, then the outcome will be determined more by players than the writers.",unknown,,37.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,USA,0,,,,https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1344994#3,,,3490223aa8557ffe91fc4feaf125c7b7,,FALSE,,,,,post,0,,5346000,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:34.982+0000,1978,,,,,forum,Forums,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Forums,,,BW_CRAWLED_FORUM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Konig Des Todes.2086,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(AP) — In a pre-pandemic world, the Academy of Country Music Awards advertised itself as country music’s night to party with gambling, after-parties and a Las Vegas-style attitude. This year the red carpet, crowds and gambling are all r eplaced with COVID-19 tests, temperature checks and face masks . The awards show was delayed five months due to the pandemic and moved to Nashville, and the tone for Wednesday’s show airing on CBS will be much more serious than in years past. “We’re celebrating but we’re not partying,” said R.A. Clark, longtime executive producer of the show. The show will feature performances by Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton with Gwen Stefani and many more, but it’s being rebranded this year as a “night of heart and hits” that will also reflect how hard the pandemic has hit many people this year, especially in the music industry. Trisha Yearwood will perform a memorial tribute performance that will likely include Kenny Rogers , Joe Diffie, Charlie Daniels and John Prine, who all died in 2020. Country singer Mickey Guyton’s performance of “What Are You Gonna Tell Her?” will highlight food insecurity. The ACMs will also showcase their charity contributions to unemployed workers in the music industry. Leading nominees include Dan + Shay, Old Dominion and Maren Morris , and all eyes will be on the entertainer of the year category. Carrie Underwood, who won the category in 2008 and 2009, seems a likely frontrunner against Eric Church, Luke Bryan, Luke Combs and Thomas Rhett after many feel she was overdue for an entertainer of the year win at the other major country awards show, the CMA Awards, last November. Swift, who makes her first return to the ACM stage in seven years , was the last female artist to win ACM entertainer of the year in 2011. Bryan, who has also won entertainer of the year twice, said Underwood has risen to the qualifications. “I certainly believe that she’s been an entertainer of all entertainers and brought so much grace and class and elegance to country music,” said Bryan. Combs, who earned his first entertainer of the year nomination this year after winning new male artist of the year last year, could prove to be an upset after amassing incredible streaming numbers with his first two records and hitting the top of Billboard’s country radio chart for nine consecutive singles. All five entertainer of the year nominees will open the show with a special medley, which Combs is hoping he doesn’t mess up alongside the other seasoned performers. “I don’t want to be the guy that shows up and is like, ‘Oops! Guess that guy’s not the entertainer of the year,’” said Combs with a laugh. The eligibility period for this year’s show was calendar year 2019 and voting ended before the pandemic hit, so the awards being handed out this late in the year may sound a little older than what is currently trending in country music. Miranda Lambert, already the most awarded artist in ACM history with over 30 wins, looks to extend her five-time win streak in the album of the year category with her record “Wildcard.” But the crossover success of Maren Morris’s album “GIRL” is also likely appeal to voters this year.

Shooting/Firearms/Prepping: * ""Four Dead Men in Five Seconds"" by Will Dabbs at Guns America. A look at the life and career of Dallas Stoudenmire, an old west gunslinger and marshal. The day after the inquest [into the death of two Mexican ranch hands by an American cattle rustler], Constable Krempkau entered a local El Paso saloon to retrieve his rifle and pistol. Inside the rustler, Johnny Hale was unarmed, intoxicated, and despondent. An armed friend of Hale’s named George Campbell made a disparaging comment about Krempkau’s performance as an interpreter at the hearing the previous day. Johnny Hale then snatched up one of Campbell’s two handguns and shot Krempkau. Marshal Stoudenmire was eating at the Globe restaurant across the street and rose to investigate. He came out shooting and killed an innocent Mexican bystander named Ochoa in short order. Johnny Hale took cover behind a thick adobe pillar. Stoudenmire spotted him peering around the edge and shot him in the face. Campbell, for his part, wanted nothing to do with these proceedings and shouted his innocence to Stoudenmire. Krempkau, now rapidly bleeding out, mistakenly thought Campbell had been the one to initially attack him and shot Campbell twice before losing consciousness. One round struck Campbell’s handgun and broke the man’s wrist. The other round passed through Campbell’s foot. Campbell shrieked in pain and reached for his dropped gun with his uninjured left hand. Stoudenmire whirled reflexively, saw the man go for his gun, and shot Campbell through the belly. Now hit three times, Campbell shouted, “You big SOB! You’ve murdered me!” Both Campbell and Krempkau bled out within minutes. Witnesses attested that the entire exchange took some five seconds. * ""'The Forgotten War:' The Men & Guns of Korea 1950""--American Rifleman. The weapons used were the same or very similar to those employed in World War II. The primary service arm was still the M1 Garand; the M1 Carbine was superseded by a select fire version designated the M2; the M1918A2 BAR was a squad's automatic rifle; and the M3A1 submachine gun had completely replaced the Thompson submachine gun. I think you would have to look to higher-tech weapons such as recoilless rifles and aircraft to really see a difference. * ""Fit A Pistol Caliber Carbine into Your Defense Plan""--Sheriff Jim Wilson. * ""Escalation Of Force: How To Choose The Appropriate Response To Potential Violence"" by Daisy Luther at Loose Rounds. The fundamental lesson to take from this article is that you can’t escalate directly to lethal force in every situation. The author points out:If you are in a situation in which you may have to defend yourself, it’s important that you understand what the threat really is. * Are you just being yelled at or mocked? * Are people just trying to intimidate or embarrass you? * Are they trying to have an actual discussion or just shout over you? * Are you outnumbered? * Are they threatening to physically attack you? * Are they capable of physically attacking you? * Are they armed with firearms, items that could be used as bludgeons, or knives?While all of these things may make you angry, if you are not in physical danger, you have to temper your response accordingly. You have to keep in mind is that one of the tactics being practiced by the rioters and protesters, against both police and ordinary people, is to try and provoke an attack by getting as close as possible without crossing over the line into where the use of force (especially lethal force) would be justified. The protesters want you (or the police) to cross the line into unjustified use of lethal force. Don't fall for their trick. * ""Threat: What are We Dealing With?""--Lizard Farmer. An excerpt: In the last entry we established a focus area to narrow down our intelligence gathering efforts on four types of threats which gave us our “Where”. Those four types of threats and a little research gives us our “Who”. Now we need to look at the “What” aspect of it. There are some very simple questions we’re going to use that may not necessarily have simple answers. Something along the lines of: 1. What is the primary basis for any given groups existence/function? 2. What violent actions or patterns of actions has each individual group been known to conduct? 3. What type of offensive capabilities do we know/assume the threat has? 4. What is the probability that we’ll eventually have to deal with “X” group? 5. What is our tribes visibility and impression to the threat? Those are four simple questions that are going to have some complex analysis applied to them. I’m not going way into the weeds with this one but my goal here is to get you to think in an analytical manner when looking at your threat. * ""Entrance Versus Exit Wounds""--Bev Fitchett's Guns. Excerpt: ""Most entrance wounds, no matter the range, are surrounded by a reddish, reddish-brown zone of abraded skin — the abrasion ring (Figure 4.16). This is a rim of flattened, abraded epidermis, surrounding the entrance hole. Fresh entrance wounds have an abrasion ring with a moist, fleshy appearance. As the abrasion ring dries out, however, it assumes the more familiar appearance."" Also: There is usually no difficulty determining that an entrance wound without an abrasion ring is truly an entrance. With the exception of the palm, sole, and elbow, these wounds are oval to circular with a punched-out clean appearance to the margins, totally unlike that of exit wounds. The exceptions to this are reentry wounds of the axilla and scrotum, which may be slit-shaped and resemble exits. Fortunately, these latter wounds are virtually all penetrating rather than perforating. In rare instances, a circular punched-out entrance without an abrasion ring is associated with an exit that also has a circular punched-out appearance, leading to confusion as to which wound is the entrance and which the exit. In such an instance a determination as to entrance versus exit may not be possible. ... Distant gunshot wounds of the head may have a stellate [looking like a star or asterix] or irregular appearance simulating a contact wound. This phenomena is seen with both handgun and rifle bullets. It is most common over bony prominence such as the orbital ridges. The author has seen this phenomena in other areas of the head as well, e.g., at the hairline; between the eyebrows; over the cheekbone; along the edge of the mandible; on the top and on the back of the head (Figure 4.22). These wounds may be incorrectly interpreted as contact wounds or exits. * “I Saw an Opportunity and I Took It.”--Active Response Training. Greg Ellifritz discusses the complete lack of empathy or remorse exhibited by most criminals. * Knock on wood, I've never had this problem: ""How to Remove a Bullet Stuck in a Firearm Barrel""--Shooting Illustrated. Short version: ""A Delrin [a type of plastic] rod, some lubrication and the proper application of a mallet will help remove a bullet stuck in your barrel."" * ""Has India Sealed the Deal? 770,000 Kalashnikov AK-203s for Indian Armed Forces""--The Firearm Blog. The AK-203 is a newer model AK with the railed and hinged top cover and an adjustable stock and, in this particular model, shooting 7.62x39mm. The selector lever and internals are largely the same as the historic AK. India had previously required that any new assault rifle be in 7.62 NATO, so the change in caliber is also interesting. * ""Head to Head: Smith & Wesson Bodyguard 38 vs. Model 642""--Shooting Illustrated. A comparison of the newer polymer framed 5-shot concealed carry revolver versus the classic J-frame. ""Some of the differences include the frame design, location of the cylinder release, improved sights and a significantly longer extractor rod."" The primary advantages to the new model, the author feels, is a slightly longer grip allowing him to get all fingers wrapped around the grip, better sights, and the longer ejector rod allowing for more positive ejection of spent cartridges. As a right-hander, moving the cylinder release to the back of the handgun was not any real advantage, but would be a ""game changer"" for a left-handed shooter. * ""How to Reduce Recoil with Shotguns""--Shooting Illustrated.

In most hot weather summer hiking, you won’t need a waterproof, insulated shoe. The shoe needs to breathe, so the moisture can leave. What about those waterproof liners that breathe while still staying waterproof? I haven’t found one yet that works well.

After noting the close ties between senior Ford Foundation directors and powerful Democrat politicians, the article continues: During the final months of the Obama presidency, Ford Foundation gave prominent leaders of the communist Workers World Party (WWP) funding to form the Southern Vision Alliance (SVA), a collective of activists that includes members of the group raining down terror in Charlotte last week at the RNC convention. Shortly after getting $200,000 from the Ford Foundation in 2016, these activists performed one of the first violent and illegal teardowns of a historic monument in the country, in Durham, North Carolina. After the activists were arrested and charged for rioting and property damage, they are being defended in court, for free, by lawyers from another Ford grantee: the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. Flush with Ford Foundation cash, these activists continue to promote property destruction and violence during demonstrations. As I've discussed before, underground movements separate tasks among independent organizations to insure plausible deniability and protect against everything being rolled up in one criminal investigation. There will be legitimate charitable organizations and foundations that collect and distribute money, which are separate from the political organization(s) which are separate from the activist organizations which are separate from the group(s) organizing and carrying out the violence.

Jacobson at Legal Insurrection. Jacobson quotes the following from a Politico article: Sanders is also going to lay out in his message to his supporters a series of steps that should be taken now to prepare for the election. He will say news organizations need to alert people that the election results may not be known on Nov. 3. Social media companies “must finally get their act together” to ensure that election officials are not harassed and disinformation is not spread on their platforms, he said…. Sanders said he is worried about what some Democratic strategists have called a “red mirage”: The appearance of a Trump lead on the night of the election in some battleground states, even if he lost, due to the fact that Republicans are more likely to vote in person, whereas many Democrats are planning to vote using mail ballots, which will take longer to count. * ""Antifa riots may be part of Democrat power grab"" by Miranda Devine at the New York Post. She explains: This rolling campaign of anti-police street violence is killing Biden’s bid for the presidency — just look at private polling in crucial swing states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where law and order has become a decisive issue. So why don’t Democratic leaders do more to condemn the violence and call for calm? To understand their inaction, you need to step back and see street violence as one element of a coordinated “playbook” to dislodge President Trump, regardless of the outcome of the election. This is the thesis of political theorist Dr. Darren Beattie, a former Duke University professor and White House official. The playbook is straight from the strategies the US government has deployed in so-called “Color Revolutions” in Eastern European countries, such as Ukraine or Belarus, to remove “authoritarian” leaders deemed hostile to American interests. In a series of articles at Revolver.news, Beattie’s thesis provides a compelling comparison between Deep State efforts to remove President Trump and techniques used by the State Department, covert agencies and allied NGOs to influence, or overturn, elections in foreign countries. BLM-Antifa’s “mostly peaceful protests” are America’s version of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, where civil unrest was fomented on the streets to oust a Kremlin-backed authoritarian. In an interview, Beattie noted “strong parallels” between “color revolutions” overseas and the “sustained coordinated coup against Trump” — from the Russia collusion hoax to his impeachment over Ukraine. “The very same regime change professionals … assigned to overthrow ‘authoritarians’ in Eastern Europe are the ones running this operation against Trump. It is the same playbook run by the same people.” The Color Revolution playbook starts by creating the narrative of an authoritarian, illegitimate leader. Then you foment unrest on the streets, aimed at provoking an authoritarian crackdown that can be used to mobilize further unrest. You undermine people’s faith in the election process, setting up a contested outcome that turns into street fighting. At the same time, you wage relentless “lawfare” to contest ballots. Ultimately the military may be called upon to dislodge the incumbent. An added twist for America is that Democrats have used the pandemic to institute mass, unsolicited mail-in ballots, which historically are open to fraud and coercion, an experiment which will leave the election result undecided on Nov. 3. * Related: ""Transition Integrity Project: Is this Soros Linked Group Plotting a “Color Revolution” Against President Trump?""--Revolver News. A ""Color Revolution"" in this context refers to a specific type of coordinated attack that the United States government has been known to deploy against foreign regimes, particularly in Eastern Europe deemed to be ""authoritarian"" and hostile to American interests. Rather than using a direct military intervention to effect regime change as in Iraq, Color Revolutions attack a foreign regime by contesting its electoral legitimacy, organizing mass protests and acts of civil disobedience, and leveraging media contacts to ensure favorable coverage to their agenda in the Western press. * * * On the one hand it is tempting to look at this as just another case of Democrat operatives falsely representing themselves as bi-partisan and getting away with it due to a compliant media. There is of course some truth to this, but in a deeper sense this interpretation misses the plot completely. The domestic Color Revolution framework hints at something far more dangerous and sinister. George Soros and his Open Society Foundation have played key roles in the Color Revolutions in Eastern Europe, including the famous Orange Revolution and Euromaidan Revolution in the Ukraine, in which mass demonstrations and acts of civil disobedience were organized in order to overthrow the target regime helmed by Russia-aligned Yanukovich. Setting aside the question of whether the overthrow of Yanukovich was justified or in American interests, what is crucial here is the similarity not only in method but even in vocabulary. Mass demonstrations are part of the Color Revolution playbook, especially when they can incite crackdowns that can then be used as further pretext to escalate demonstrations against the target regime. * * * Just in case Biden isn’t able to win fair and square, they have introduced a mail-in voting system that dramatically increases the likelihood of some type of contested election scenario. If that occurs, the outcome of the election will no longer be in the realm of democratic choice, where perhaps the forces against Trump have a disadvantage. Instead, the election becomes an issue of sustained mass mobilization of demonstrators capitalizing on every opportunity for escalation, a full court press by media demonizing every effort by Trump to restore order as authoritarian, and a transmission of the electoral process to court battles which disadvantage Trump. There is of course one scenario, a very dark one, that remains unexplored. If the Color Revolution against Trump frames him as an authoritarian unwilling to leave office, the only alternative is to remove him by force. Both Al Gore and Joe Biden have already taken the extremely irresponsible and dangerous step of floating a military role in removing Trump should their Color Revolution not turn out the way they plan. Read the whole thing. * The view from the Left: ""The Left Secretly Preps for MAGA Violence After Election Day""--Daily Beast. Over the course of two hours, participants broached the question of what the progressive political ecosystem can functionally do in a series of election scenarios. They began charting out what it would take to stand up a multi-state communications arm to fight disinformation, a training program for nonviolent civil disobedience, and the underpinnings of what one official described as “mass public unrest.” And they pored over a report from the Transition Integrity Project, a bipartisan group formed in 2019, that analyzed various election-season scenarios and made clear the type of ratfuckery, corruption, and chaos that potentially was ahead. “The potential for violent conflict is high,” the report noted. Some of the hurdles were straightforward: how you “occupy shit, hold space, and shut things down, not just on Election Day but for weeks,” explained one source familiar with the Democracy Defense Nerve Center operations. Others are more complicated, like what quick transportation options can be in place should poll locations mysteriously close. Others have been simply impossible to plan out. “I don’t know what the strategy is when armed right-wing militia dudes show up in polling places,” the same source said. “This [Kyle] Rittenhouse guy is being lionized on the right, right now. If it is being unleashed that you can shoot people and be a hero, I don’t know what preparation we can possibly do for that.” Those involved in the conversation say this wide an array of groups has never coordinated so closely on these matters before. And the fact that they were sitting down some two months in advance of the election, was a testament to how seriously they take the complications and threats Election Day poses. One of the scenarios that the Leftists were particularly interested in was Pres. Trump or Attorney General Barr taking some action to terminate the counting of mail-in ballots to bring some closure to the election, and what the Left could do if that happened: Beyond demonstrations, Team Biden was also able to recruit 1,000 influencers, all living presidents, moderate Republican governors, and, eventually, some Republican senators to denounce Trump’s refusal to keep counting ballots or to leave office. From there, more hardball tactics followed. The simulation saw Team Biden work with “local Democratic elected officials to call on the Adjutant General of the National Guard, along with representatives from the technology sector, to monitor vote counting.” They also attempted “a capital strike and a work stoppage as part of an overall effort to push corporate leaders to insist that all ballots be counted.” * ""Democrats’ new strategy for winning the White House: Threaten riots if they lose"" by Jonathan S. Tobin at the New York Post. For all of their frightening predictions of what Trump might do if he loses, the one thing we already know is that it is the Democrats who will, as Clinton advised Biden, never concede defeat. Though some of Trump’s trolling of the media and the left is interpreted as betraying his plans to overturn the results, Democrats have already shown us outright how they react to losing. This time, Democrats won’t be relying on conspiracy theories or politicized investigations. Instead, they are counting on a strategy intended to scare Americans into voting for Biden — even if they have misgivings about handing over the government to a confused figurehead and his radical supporters. After a summer of (ahem) “mostly peaceful” Black Lives Matter protests that unleashed violence and looting in American cities, most recently in Rochester, is there a shred of doubt in anyone’s mind that the same combination of elite liberals, criminal thugs and Antifa Marxists would be deployed to burn and destroy the moment it appears that Trump might be winning? Behind all that high-minded talk from pompous columnists about virtuous patriots stopping Trump from cheating is a brazen threat. They’re saying in effect: The same forces that have wreaked havoc in the name of a false charge that America is an irredeemably racist nation may well inflict even worse damage in order to ensure that Trump’s re-election is thwarted. That’s the subtext of the talk from Biden supporters about democracy. Their ace in the hole isn’t an accurate count of the votes but the certainty that America’s cities will burn unless the electorate bows to their demands. * Convincing the military to back the Leftists: ""Veterans are divided about reports Trump disparaged military""--AP. * Related: ""Atlantic Editor Concedes Central Claim Of Trump Hit Piece Could Be Wrong""--The Federalist.

Smith just assumes that American whites hate blacks, sidesteps the question of why (because that would require examining whether her hypothesis was true), and tries to link the imaginary hatred with events that happened in the Southern Colonies in the 17th Century. Smith writes: Consequently, in examining the question of when white people started hating Black people, it can be reasonably deduced as having started as early as the 1600s. when the wealthy white landowners used their common skin color for no other reason than to mollify poor and “regular” whites by differentiating them from the enslaved by color and status of “free” and “slave,” separating them, and then by encouraging animosity, even going through extreme lengths, to promote contempt for Black people. The reality is that the vast majority of white Americans don't hate blacks. They are, for lack of a better term, indifferent or neutral toward blacks. But that doesn't suit the Leftist worldview, nor the vanity of black Leftists. They want white Americans to care about or consider blacks (or, at least, pay attention to their blackness) even if only to hate blacks. That is, black Leftists would rather that white people hate blacks than be neutral and color-blind. * Paging Colin Flaherty: ""Black Georgia Man Who Stabbed Stranger Because He ‘Felt the Need to Find a White Male to Kill,’ Murders His White Cell Mate Following His Arrest""--Gateway Pundit. * Second page for Colin Flaherty: ""Sickening moment mugger drags and then slams woman, 85, walking with a cane on the ground during brutal robbery on Chicago's Magnificent Mile""--Daily Mail. * Third page for Colin Flaherty: ""Dramatic moment four hero firefighters chased down brute on a bike after he punches woman on Brooklyn street""--Daily Mail. * ""Two women are charged with hate crimes for stealing a MAGA hat from a terrified seven-year-old boy and throwing it over the wall outside the DNC""--The Daily Mail.

Rather than summarize the article or post long-excerpts, I'm going to give an example of geopolitics. In The Next 100 Years by George Friedman and The Clash of Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington, geopolitics are front and center. Friedman, for instance, believed that the key to United States power this century wasn't going to be merely due to technological advancements or industrial power, but because of America's geographical position between Europe and Eastern Asia. That is, the United States was in a key position to trade with both Europe and Eastern Asia because of its access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

ways going to be more important than by railway because of the limits on the volume of goods that can be trafficked over a rail line versus by sea. Similarly, Huntington predicted that the United State's greatest geopolitical rival will not be the East Asian powers, but Mexico, and for the reason that it occupies essentially the same geographic sweet spot as the United States. Huntington's book is likewise interested in maps and the borders between civilizations. His thesis is that as the Pax Americana fades, conflicts will arise along the borders between the great civilizations--particularly between Islam and the rest of the world (Islam has, as he described," """"bloody borders""""). * Making America Great Again: """"Labor Day Win: CEOs Hire Americans Because Donald Trump Excludes Visa Workers""""--Breitbart.

Feinstein is opposing proposed legislation """"that would require companies that wish to compete for NASA contracts to pass", in essence," a background check to ensure they are not compromised by China."""" We know that her driver of two decades was a traitor and spy for the Chinese. Some more background: To Feinstein", China always has been more than a geopolitical competitor. After the U.S. normalized relations with China in 1972, Feinstein was one of the first mayors to set up sister-city agreements with Chinese communities. She linked San Francisco, where she was mayor at the time, to Shanghai, whose mayor then happened to be Jiang Zemin, later president of China. They became fast friends – Zemin spent a Thanksgiving at Feinstein’s house in San Francisco and even danced with her in the evening – and the relationship between Zemin and her investor husband, Richard Blum, grew significantly. She worked with Zemin to establish corporate partnerships, to eliminate the link between most-favored-nation status, which the Chinese coveted so they could join the World Trade Organization, and China’s serial human rights abuses. Zemin helped Blum raise $150 million for an Asia-focused fund for his venture capital firm, Newbridge Capital. The firm would go on to invest more than $400 million in China, including in ventures such as Northwest Airlines, then the only airline with direct flights to all major Chinese cities, and the Shenzhen Development Bank, the first time the Chinese would allow an American firm to take control of such a group. She blocked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, from moving to rename a Washington, D.C. street for Liu Xiaobo, a Nobel-winning human rights activist jailed for speaking out against the regime. She blocked the bill twice, and Xiaobo died in custody. She forced the Obama administration to abandon a $6 billion arms deal with Taiwan. In the early 1980s, she also got the organizers of the Chinese New Year Parade in San Francisco to stop displaying Taiwan’s flag. She even worked to get meetings for Chinese officials so they could explain the missile tests they performed near Taiwan to frighten the island nation. Feinstein also was heavily involved in the scandal in which John Huang, a Chinese businessman, pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws by contributing the campaigns of Bill Clinton and other top Democrats to curry favor on other matters. Feinstein had to return a $12,"000 contribution as a result of the investigation. * Related: """"Chinese researcher charged with destroying evidence relating to illegal transfer of US tech""""--ZDNet.

Under American jurisprudence," mistakes like that are typically not actionable because public policy is to make such calls to the police privileged from suit in order to encourage people to report crimes.

As the years roll by", contemporary Christian churches increasingly abnegate their scripturally-prescribed role as fortified beacons of divine truth, and instead transform themselves into vehicles for a social justice pseudo-gospel completely incompatible with Christian (or Jewish, for that matter) scriptural teachings. This has been going on for decades, of course, but its most striking manifestation of late has been the near-total failure of the Christian church to expose and reject the destructive fraud that is Black Lives Matter. That kind of failure requires extraordinary ignorance, extraordinary cowardice, or both. After all, it's not like the veil hasn't come off Black Lives Matter, if it was ever there in the first place. Its founders openly profess their allegiance to Marxism, history's most genocidal ideology. Its members repeatedly encourage violence, destruction," and even murder.

An excerpt: To walk with Christ means to be concerned about your salvation. As Christians we are encouraged to sanctify our souls to prepare for the next life. This means turning away from all sin—fornication", lust, greed, pride, gluttony, and so on. I was addicted to fornication, and through God’s grace, I was able to stop it. Masturbation is never acceptable, since it’s a form of self-abuse, and I don’t intend to have sex again unless I get married. “You’ve gone off the deep end! You’ve gone from one extreme to the next!” To the faithless, chastity is extreme. To men of the world, following the basic commandments of Christianity is fanatical. I follow only the absolute minimum of Christianity. I’m not going above and beyond and I’m not inventing my own rules. Praying daily, corporate worship (in church), and avoiding sin is Christianity 101, and for people to attack that shines a light on the darkness they allow to enter into their own lives. If someone thinks abstaining from fornication is extreme, we know what they treasure. If someone thinks taking twenty minutes out of the day to glorify God through prayer is too much, we know the sort of distractions and entertainments that occupy their mind. If someone thinks spending two hours with fellow Christians on Sunday is excessive, we know how actively their worship at the altar of sportsball, brunch, hangovers," and gossip. * """"The Divine Purposes of Sexual Intimacy"""" by Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and Ruth Lybbert Renlund. Key part: The law of chastity is an eternal law", given by our Heavenly Father to all His children in all ages. It remains in force and is as applicable today as it was in earlier times in history. As with other commandments, the law is given by Heavenly Father to bless and help His children achieve their divine potential. Obeying the law of chastity includes abstaining from all sexual relations before marriage and remaining completely faithful and loyal after marriage. Sexual relations are to be limited to marriage between a man and a woman.1 Heavenly Father intends that sexual relations in marriage be used to create children and to express love and strengthen the emotional, spiritual, and physical connections between husband and wife. In marriage, sexual intimacy should unite wife and husband together in trust, devotion," and consideration for each other. * """"Interactive map lets you track the location of your hometown on the Earth as the planet changes over 750 million years""""--Daily Mail.

This was discovered by the Indian Space Research Organization's Chandrayaan-1 orbiter team in 2008. The team has also located various minerals on the lunar surface, but finding hematite was a surprise. Hematite is a form of iron oxide that typically forms when the iron is exposed to oxygen and liquid water. While other processes can form hematite," these would be hindered by the presence of hydrogen. Hydrogen is present on the lunar surface due to solar wind. So how is hematite forming on the Moon? * A reminder we live in the 21st Century: """"Japanese company successfully tests a manned flying car for the first time""""--CNN. It's not a flying car in the sense of a car that converts into an aircraft", but a small personalized VTOL aircraft that would facilitate personal air commuting; e.g.," an air-taxi that comes to your home and picks you up. It is obviously based on the technology from the development of personal quad-rotor drones. * Related: """"Airline Pilots Landing At LAX Report A Guy In Jetpack Flying Alongside Them""""--The Drive. The important part of the story isn't that the person seen was in a jetpack", but that he was seen in a jetpack at 3,000 ft altitude," which suggests some major improvements over known fuel/power use in jetpacks/flying suits. I understand from other articles that the FBI is investigating. * """"Preconscious Processing and Training Design""""--Marcus Wynne. He explains that when we perceive the world (receive data)"," that data goes through preconscious filters which """"create either familiar patterns", fragments of familiar patterns, or new patterns," the """"patterns are recognized or fit into the schema"," and """"then the human brain makes up a narrative", or story," about the pattern."""" and", then," when """"we act on our narrative", and rely on our perception," pattern recognition and the evolving narrative to PREDICT the next step in the story and act accordingly."""" There are a few general ways to develop or change these preconscious filters", according to Wynne; and one of the examples he gives is as follows:One way to shape desirable attributes and preconscious filters is to create learning experiences to shape new cognitive pathways. The SEAL BUD/S training program Hell Week does an excellent job of that. It’s the SUCCESSFUL completion of that week that creates a different preconscious filter for what is possible under extreme stress. I've been wanting to post about the purpose of our mortal existence, for it truly has a purpose in God's plans. But I've been sort of hung up on trying to effectively convey that purpose. Of course, there is the general plan of salvation as I learned in my youth at Church--we were spirits prior to our existence, we are born in this mortal world and thus receive a physical body, we die, and eventually we will be resurrected (i.e., our spirits will be reunited with our bodies) and be judged. However, this is a road-map showing the legs of our journey and not really a statement of purpose. The holy scripture teach us that this life is a test. Which is well and good, as far as that goes, but it doesn't tell us why we have to be tested and the purpose of the test. Other teachings indicate that this life is also a time of learning and growth, and I think that brings us a bit closer to understanding," but still doesn't answer the """"why?"""" of it. But going through some scripture", I think we can intuit much of the purpose. Although Christ is the only begotten of the Father in the flesh, we are all children of God in the spirit. See e.g., Romans 8:16-17, 21; Act 17:29; Psalm 82:6. See also Luke 11:2 (Christ instructing us, when we pray," to say: """"Our Father which art in heaven ...""""). We were formed in His image. See Gen. 1:26. And", as Paul explains," """"And if children", then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him," that we may be also glorified together."""" Romans 8:17. Christ is", of course, preeminent. As Paul describes in Chapter 1 of Hebrews: 1 God [speaking of the Father], who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he [the Father] hath appointed heir of all things, by whom [speaking of Christ] also he [the Father] made the worlds; 3 Who [speaking of Christ] being the brightness of his [the Father's] glory, and the express image of his [the Father's] person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he [Christ] had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty [the Father] on high; 4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he [Christ] hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. 5 For unto which of the angels said he [the Father] at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? 6 And again, when he [the Father] bringeth in the firstbegotten [Christ] into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. 7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. 8 But unto the Son he [the Father] saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 10 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: 11 They [the heavens and the earth] shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment; 12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. 13 But to which of the angels said he [the Father] at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool? 14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?We, of course," are those """"who shall be heirs of salvation"""" through Christ's sacrifice"," """"[f]or we are made partakers of Christ", if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end, Heb. 3:14," """"know[ing] that it is by grace that we are saved"," after all we can do."""" 2 Nephi 25:23. We can obtain additional insight by examining why Christ had to partake of mortality in order to become our judge. Turning again to Hebrews", Chapter 2, we see essentially two reasons given: to overcome physical and spiritual death. Heb. 2:14-18. And, more relevant to the point here," we read in verse 18: """"For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted"," he is able to succour them that are tempted."""" And", later, in Chapter 5," verses 8 and 9: """"Though he were a Son", yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect," he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him[.]"""" In other words", going through a mortal existence allowed Christ to perfect the empathy and understanding needed to be our Savior and Judge. But Christ is also our example. For instance, we read in the scriptures that man was made a little lower than the angels, yet all things were to be made subject to man. [1] Heb. 2:6-8; Psalm 8:4-6; Genesis 1:26. Obviously, this has not yet happened, but is something still in the future. But if we are to be joint heirs with Christ, it is logical to conclude that we will also share in His power and authority. We get a sense of how great this power and authority might be from certain of the scriptures. For instance, turning to the Septuagint," Exodus 7:1 we read: """"And the Lord spoke to Moses", saying, Behold, I have made thee a god to Pharao," and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet."""" The Old Testament prophet Elijah was given power to call down fire from heaven", and Elisha performed numerous miracles including separating waters so he could cross on dry land and healing waters. In Revelation, Chapter 11," we read of two latter-day prophets that will have the power to send fire """"out of their mouth", [to] devoureth their enemies," and """"have power to shut heaven", that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues," as often as they will."""" We also saw examples in the Old Testament of the power of angels", including the angel of death that killed all the first born of the Egyptians, and the angel of 2 Kings 19:35 which killed 185,000 men of Sennacherib's Assyrian army. Obviously, then, we must be tested to see if we will be obedient to God and learn the necessary empathy, understanding, and self-control to hold and exercise such power and authority without abusing it or using it contrary to the Father's will. Earlier this year," Greg Ellifritz posted an article with the title """"Cops: The Young versus The Old"""" which actually helped to express this point. Ellifritz laments the fact that the experienced cops generally are not the ones on the street", and the lack of experience results in a lack of empathy and understanding. Looking back at his own history as an officer, he writes: We hire young guys and gals in their early 20s. They have essentially zero life experience. They possess a college degree and have generally lived a pretty smooth life. They haven’t ever been arrested, they have no substance abuse problems, and they don’t have an unreasonable amount of debt. * * * Our new cops have generally never experienced the crushing loss of a loved one or a friend’s death. They don’t know anyone who is addicted to pain pills or who drinks a bottle of vodka every night to keep the demons at bay. They’ve never dealt with schizophrenia or autism or paranoia. They’ve never been in a romantic relationship that has gone so badly that one party or the other resorts to physical violence. What do you think cops deal with on a daily basis? Drug addiction. Alcoholism. Mental illness. Crushing poverty. Family problems and dead bodies. Lots of poor judgement. Because our young cops haven’t directly experienced such things, they lack a certain perspective when it comes to dealing with those problems. Without such perspective, they default to making arrests. Young cop sees a person breaking a law. Young cop arrests the law breaker. Problem solved, at least from the perspective of the young cop. In reality, arrests seldom really solve any problems. But it takes 15 or 20 years of arresting people before a cop realizes that fact. I was the same way. I got hired as a cop when I was 22 years old. I had graduated college three months before and was still living with my parents. For my first few years, I led the department in numbers of arrests. I arrested every law breaker I found and thought I was doing the right thing. I remember the first time I recognized that all my arrests might be less productive than I had originally believed. I had a couple years of experience and was working the midnight shift. I found two guys who were shit-faced drunk and staggering in the middle of a busy roadway at 2 a.m. I immediately arrested the two guys for public intoxication. They were legitimately in danger of being run over by a car in their drunken condition and I thought I was doing the right thing by pulling them out of the roadway and taking them to jail. When I got them to the station, they told me their story. The two men were brothers. Their father had died earlier in the week. Their deceased father wished to be cremated and have his ashes scattered in a nearby river where he liked to fish. The sons wanted to honor their father’s wishes, but didn’t want to get in any trouble for scattering the cremains in the water. They chose to do the deed under the cover of darkness when they were less likely to be seen. They passed the evening by drinking beer, talking about their dead father, and waiting for the level of darkness they needed to conceal their illegal dumping. They were really drunk by the time they thought it was best to scatter the ashes. They didn’t want to hurt anyone by driving in that condition, so they carried the ashes to the river on foot. They were walking home when they encountered the young cop who arrested them. I remember the desk officer (who had about 25 years experience) looking at me after these guys told their story. He told me: “You made a bullshit arrest.” I didn’t understand him at the time. I thought I was saving these guys from getting hit by a car. Now I realize I was being a dick. Those guys didn’t need to go to jail. They needed to be treated with compassion during a difficult time. Unfortunately, the police academy doesn’t teach compassion. That can only be learned through a lifetime of experience and practice. The police academy teaches young recruits how to arrest criminals so that’s exactly what I did. Now if I encountered the same dudes in a similar situation, I’d probably give them a ride home instead of a set of steel bracelets. That’s the value of a couple decades worth of perspective.I would contend that our mortal existence is mostly to learn self-control and empathy, compassion, charity, or whatever name you want to give it. Obviously, some people will be dealt better hands than others in the game of life, but all of us will have to pass through hardships and trials. The test is how we deal with these trials. To those that pass the test," they will be told """"thou hast been faithful over a few things"," I will make thee ruler over many things."""" See Matthew 25:14-30 (the parable of the talents). Falling back on my inner nerd", I initially compared our mortal existence as being like the Kobayashi Maru test in Star Trek II--The Wrath of Khan which was a no-win test designed to test the character of those being trained to be commanding officers. But, as I discussed above, life is more than a test, but an opportunity to learn. Wynne's article fills in a missing piece of understanding the why of life. It alters us, for the better if we choose it. With that, the initial training and selection of SEALs, culminating in Hell Week, is actually a much better analogy to the purpose of life. By rejecting Satan and not joining with the one third of the heavenly hosts that rebelled against God," we essentially made it through the initial selection and training and merely needed to move on to our """"Hell Week", so to speak, of mortal life. As Wynne notes," """"[i]t’s the SUCCESSFUL completion of that week that creates a different preconscious filter for what is possible under extreme stress."""" The SEALs that get through Hell Week go on to additional training and deployment", trusted and depended on by our country to use expensive equipment and training to solve difficult problems. Successful completion of life, I believe, will allow us to go on to additional growth, learning," and responsibilities with which God will entrust us. Notes:[1] The wording is somewhat confusing because it discusses both """"man"""" (i.e."," humans generally) and """"son of man", which is typically a reference to Christ. So," it could just be referring to everything being made subject to Christ. But for it to only refer to Christ makes the reference to """"man"""" (generally) void and of no purpose"," as well as contradicting Genesis 1:26: """"And God said", Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth," and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.""""""",unknown,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,http://practicaleschatology.blogspot.com/2020/09/a-quick-run-around-web-9102020.html,,,f44278bb4b21a3c1d313d11532e9c705,,FALSE,,,,,post,0,,0,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:11.317+0000,,,,,,blog,Blogs,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Blogs,,,BOARDREADER_BLOGS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This subreddit is toxic AF and if it represents the province's voters it explains why we're in the shape we're in. Voting for MHAs and MPs for handouts rather than job investments. CBC comments are much alike. People think that all the people who work in oil and gas are uneducated people who can easily find a job in another industry. In reality there are engineers & technologists of various disciplines, chemists, nurses, red seal tradesmen (electricians, millwrights, carpenters, instrument techs, scaffolders, chefs, etc), master mariners, telecomms techs, and many other skilled workers who spent years training and specializing offshore in O&G. If Husky pulls the plug on this project then the clock starts ticking for Searose as her production is already on a decline. Suncor is in a similar boat with Terra Nova. If you get rid of Searose and Terra Nova that will equate to thousands of direct job losses and a gigantic blow to the province's economy as a whole. I don't know if you people think that tourism and the fishery will keep this province afloat. We can't even keep it afloat now prior to mass layoffs. There are a lot of jealous people in this province and the crab mentality is strong. I'd be willing to bet if you offered one of these tree hugging shit talkers a 6 figure job in O&G they would gladly quit Dominion and change their tune in a heartbeat. A lot of people in this province will be nothing short of devastated if half the production rigs offshore are axed. Get your head out of your holes and think about your neighbours instead of screeching and bawling about the environment (which our offshore does an incredible job to protect and has a great track record compared to other oil producing countries) Alright folks do what you do best and downvote this without a proper rebuttal because it triggers your emotions.",unknown,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/ipfhr1/jobs_billions_at_risk_as_husky_announces_sweeping/g4l4s76/,,,71c6390000bdc5ca5f6b058e4e337edc,,FALSE,,,,,reply,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/ipfhr1/jobs_billions_at_risk_as_husky_announces_sweeping/,1688556000,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:15.870+0000,,,,,,reddit,Reddit,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Reddit,,g4kd11s,BW_REDDIT_REPLY,,,0,0,0,,6,,,,,ipfhr1,,,,,,,,newfoundland,0,ImFromNewfoundlandBy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W.) from Llanerchymedd; containing 136 inhabitants. This place, which derives its name from the dedication of its church to St. Flewyn, by whom the building was originally founded, in the early part of the seventh century, is situated in the north-western part of the island, and finely sheltered on the north by a chain of hills, by which it is separated from the parish of Llanvechell. It appears to have been visited, if not permanently inhabited, by the Romans, on their conquest of Anglesey; three golden bracelets, of which two were purchased by Mr. Pennant, and a bulla of the same metal, having been found on a farm within its limits, called Ynys Gwyddel, a few years prior to Mr. Pennant's visiting this part of the principality. In this, and also in the adjoining parish, are numerous vestiges of Saxon and Danish occupation. The surface is boldly undulated, and the soil consequently various; the lands are for the greater part inclosed, and in a good state of cultivation; the scenery is diversified, and from the higher grounds are obtained some interesting views. The living is a perpetual curacy, annexed to the rectory of Llanrhyddlad; the tithes have been commuted for a rentcharge of £136. The church, a plain edifice, is beautifully situated near a small lake, and surrounded with pleasing scenery. There are places of worship for Calvinistic and Wesleyan Methodists. A trifling benefaction was given by William David, at a period unknown, for the use of the poor, who also receive a portion of a small rent-charge from Richard David's charity, in the parish of Llantrisaint. Llanvrothen (Llan-Frothen) LLANVROTHEN (LLAN-FROTHEN), a parish, in the union of Festiniog, hundred of Ardudwy, county of Merioneth, North Wales, 3 miles (W. N. W.) from Tan-y-Bwlch; containing 853 inhabitants. The parish derives its name from the dedication of its church to Brothen, an eminent British saint, who flourished about the end of the sixth century. It is situated between the two estuaries of the Traeth Mawr and Traeth Bâch, and on the high road between Bethgelart and Tan-y-Bwlch; and comprises a tract of about 6000 acres, whereof 200 are arable, 4477 pasture, 1106 mountainous land, and 134 wood, comprehending oak, ash, elm, birch, and beech, but consisting chiefly of oak, which is here, and in most parts of the county, the prevailing timber. The surface is boldly undulated, rising in some parts into mountainous elevations, and the surrounding scenery is strikingly diversified, combining features of romantic aspect and picturesque beauty. In the parish is a romantic valley, situated in the heart of the mountains, and designated Croesawr, a name said to have originated in an exclamation of grief uttered by Helen, the queen of Constantine, whose only son falling into her arms after he had been shot by a poisoned arrow, she cried out, ""Oh! croesawr, croesawr i mi,"" signifying, ""alas! to me, ill-fated hour."" Various small streams here join the Glâslyn, or, as it is commonly termed, the Traeth Mawr river; and there is a small lake called Cwmvoel. The soil exhibits several varieties, and comprises argillaceous, calcareous, and siliceous marls, producing chiefly oats, barley, and potatoes, with a small quantity of wheat. Some of the best land is that secured from the sea by an embankment formed at the mouth of the Traeth Mawr, about forty years since; the soil in this part is a rich and fertile clay, and the crops are particularly fine. Large flocks of sheep are pastured on the mountains in the summer, and retire in the winter to the lowlands, supplying a large quantity of wool, which makes a principal part of the disposable stock of the parish. Peat, which constitutes the chief fuel of the inhabitants, is found in abundance in various places. At Bwlch Plwm is a lead-mine, occupying from twelve to twenty hands; and at Pantywrach is a copper-mine, employing from twenty to twenty-five: slate is also known to exist in the parish, and gold is supposed to have been anciently procured. The gentlemen's seats are, Brondanw, Park, and Plâsnewydd: they are very ancient mansions, and the two latter formerly belonged to the Wynne family. The village of Llanvrothen stands about a quarter of a mile from the high road, and there is a hamlet called Carregpenargyfin in the parish. The living is a discharged rectory, rated in the king's books at £6. 15., and endowed with £200 royal bounty; present gross income, £106. 10.; patron, the Bishop of Bangor. The tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £99. 10.; and there is a glebe of seven acres, with a house, valued together at £20 per annum. The church is an ancient, commodious, and well-built edifice, measuring sixtysix feet in length and twenty in breadth, and containing 195 sittings, of which 52 are free. There are places of worship for Baptists and Calvinistic Methodists, the latter of whom support a Sunday school. Evan Thomas, in 1732, bequeathed £20; William Lewis Anwyl left £10; and John Carreg, £20: of these sums £30 were lost, having been lent to a farmer who became insolvent; but the interest of the residue, together with two rent-charges of 5 s . and 10 s ., by Gwen Prichard in 1715, and Mrs. Lloyd in 1784, is distributed among the poor at Christmas. There is also a bequest of £1. 15. per annum, by an unknown benefactor, to be appropriated to the instruction of children. Llanvrynach (Llan-Frynach) LLANVRYNACH (LLAN-FRYNACH), a parish, in the hundred of Pencelly, union and county of Brecknock, South Wales, 3 miles (S. E.) from Brecknock; containing 350 inhabitants, of whom 239 are in the Upper division, and 111 in the Lower division. This parish derives its name from the dedication of its church to Brynach, a celebrated Irish saint, who accompanied Brychan Brycheiniog into Britain, in the fifth century, and presided over some of the monastic institutions founded by that prince. It is a place of great antiquity, and appears to have been occupied at an early period by the Romans, in connexion with their works in the mineral districts of Bryn Oer, through which the course of a Roman vicinal way from Cardiff, or from Caerphilly, has been satisfactorily traced, leading directly to this place. That the district was worked in some remote age is evident from the scoria of ancient smelting-works, especially on a field called Clos y Geveilon, or ""the field of the forge;"" but that the works belonged to the Romans was not satisfactorily ascertained till the year 1775, when the remains of a Roman bath were discovered, in which a piece of malleable iron was found, four feet long and six inches wide. The parish comprises 7127 acres, of which 3500 acres are common or waste land. It is bounded on the south-east by the stream Mehascin, and on the west by the Cynrig; these rivers are crossed by bridges kept in repair by the hundred, and both fall into the Usk, by which the parish is skirted for nearly two miles on the north-east, and over which is a good stone bridge, built in 1773, and kept in repair at the expense of the county. The Brecknock and Abergavenny canal passes through the parish, and is carried over the Usk, near the bridge, by a handsome stone aqueduct of four arches. The village stands near the turnpike-road that proceeds along the left bank of the Usk from Brecon to Abergavenny; and the neighbourhood abounds with finely varied scenery, in which the rivers that flow by the parish, with their bridges, and the distant woods and plantations, form pleasing features. The views from the higher grounds are interesting and extensive, embracing the magnificent range of mountains called the Brecknockshire Beacons, the lowest of which borders on the parish, and the small wood on the estate of Dinas, which has a very beautiful appearance. The seat Tŷ Mawr is supposed to have been originally built in the reign of Edward II. by Howel Gam, eldest son of Grufydd ab Meredydd, who was lineally descended from Brychan, Prince of Brycheiniog, now Brecknock. It had fallen into neglect, and was for many years in the occupation of a farmer, but has been restored and embellished, in the later style of English architecture; the grounds, though flat, are tastefully disposed, and are enriched with numerous flourishing plantations. Maes-Derwen is a neat modern edifice, situated on a gentle eminence under the majestic chain of the Brecknockshire mountains; it forms a conspicuous object from several parts of the surrounding country, and commands a fine view of a portion of the Vale of Usk, and of the neighbouring heights by which it is inclosed. Tregaer , formerly the seat of the Vaughan family, has been converted into a farmhouse. The living is a rectory, rated in the king's books at £4. 10. 7½.; the tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £300, and there is a neat glebe-house, with a glebe of three acres. The advowson anciently belonged to the lords of Brecknock, and upon the attainder of Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, became vested in the crown. It was granted by Queen Elizabeth to Dr. William Aubrey, by whose descendant, Sir William Aubrey, it was sold; and from the purchaser it descended to John Waters, Esq., whose only daughter conveyed it by marriage to the family of Tynte: the trustees of the late Rev. C. Clifton are the present patrons. The church, dedicated to St. Brynach, and now in a dilapidated condition, is a very ancient structure, with a massive square tower at the west end; the body consists of a nave and chancel, which are separated by a small gallery, probably the remains of the old rood-loft. The churchyard is one of the largest in the county, but contains only a small number of tombs, of which none are remarkable. A Church school is chiefly supported by the family residing at Maes-Derwen; and there are two Sunday schools, one of them in connexion with the Established Church, and the other held by the Baptists in their place of worship here. Herbert Aubrey, of Clehonger, Esq., by deed, in 1668, gave a rentcharge of £6 on a tenement named Pen-y-Vagwyr, in Peterchurch, county of Hereford, to be annually divided among the poor of the parish at Christmas. The Roman remains above mentioned as having been discovered in 1775, were situated in a field called Cae'r-maen-bâch, near the village, and were destroyed by the proprietor of the land, in order to avoid the annoyance to which he was subjected by the intense public interest which they excited, and which could be restrained within no bounds. From a drawing made soon after the discovery, and preserved in Mr. Jones' History of Brecknockshire, it appears that there were one warm and two cold baths, about seven feet four inches long, five feet one inch in width, and four feet deep. The tessellated pavement was formed of small blue, white, and red tesseræ, varying in size from half an inch to an inch in diameter, and was supported on dwarf pillars of brick, about three feet and a half high, between which were laid down flues communicating with the warm bath. Many Roman coins, still preserved, have been found here, among which are several of Constantine, and one of Valentinian. Two sympuria were also discovered, one made of copper, and the other of a mixed metal: these instruments, which resemble narrow spoons, are supposed by some antiquaries to have been used for pouring oil on the victims in sacrifices, and by others they are thought to have been used as lachrymatories. No vestiges of military fortification are now visible in the parish; but the names of two tenements, called respectively ""Tregaer"" and ""Caerau,"" appear to indicate the existence of such works at some period. In a field designated Cae Gwyn was an immense heap of loose stones, under which, on their removal in 1808, was found a cistvaen, formed of four stones, placed on their edges, and supporting a fifth in an horizontal position: human bones were discovered both within and on the lid of the cistvaen, which is supposed to be coeval with the appearance of the Romans in Britain, if not of an earlier date. Brychan Brycheiniog , one of the native reguli, who after the departure of the Romans governed this part of the principality, and gave his name to the district, is supposed to have resided in the parish, and to have founded the church, within the walls of which he is said to have been interred. The parish has been the birthplace of several individuals highly distinguished for their literary attainments, or by the offices of importance to which their talents raised them. Among these was Dr. William Aubrey , of All Souls' College, Oxford, principal of New Inn Hall, regius professor of civil law, advocate in the court of Arches, member of the council in the Marches of Wales, master in chancery, chancellor to Archbishop Whitgift, and master in ordinary of the court of requests; he died in 1595, and was buried on the south side of the choir of St. Paul's cathedral, London. William Aubrey was chancellor of the diocese of St. David's in 1514; and Thomas of the same family, and also a native of the parish, subsequently held the same office. John Aubrey of Easton Percy, in the county of Wilts, who was a descendant of the family, assisted Dugdale in his compilation of the Monasticon; he was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society, and published several works, among which was a Natural History of Surrey: he died in 1700. John Jones , the intimate friend of Archbishop Laud, was born in the parish, in 1575. He received the earlier part of his education in Merchant Tailors' school, London, whence he proceeded to Merton College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow. He afterwards embraced the Roman Catholic religion, and went into Spain, where he was chosen a brother of the Benedictine monastery of Compostella, upon which occasion he assumed the name of Leander de Sancto Martino. Having taken his degree of doctor of divinity, he removed to Douay, where he was for many years professor of Hebrew in the chapel of Vedrastus, and was subsequently made prior of the Benedictine college of St. Gregory, in that place; he was also appointed vicar-general of the English Benedictines living in Spain, twice president of the Benedictines in England, and titular prior of the Catholic church of Canterbury. Upon the invitation of Archbishop Laud he returned to England, where he died in 1636, and was interred in the chapel of the Capuchins, near Somerset House, in the Strand, London. Llanvwrog (Llan-Fwrog) LLANVWROG (LLAN-FWROG), a parish, in the hundred of Tàlybolion, union and county of Anglesey, North Wales, 4 miles (N. W.) from Bôdedern; containing 267 inhabitants. It is situated on the shore of the Irish Sea, by which it is bounded on the west and south-west; and contains a considerable tract of inclosed and fertile land: the views from the higher grounds over the adjacent country and the Irish Sea are interesting and extensive. The living is a perpetual curacy, annexed to the rectory of Llanvaethlu: the tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £275. 3. 1., and there is a glebe of 8 a . 2 r . 21 p ., valued at £10 per annum. The church, dedicated to St. Mwrog, is a small ancient edifice, in a very dilapidated condition, containing some curious remains of oak carving; over the north entrance is a mutilated inscription, of which only a few of the letters, rudely formed, are remaining. According to tradition, there was once a chapel in a field called Monwent Mwrog, on the farm of Cevn Glâs, in the parish; but not a vestige of it is now to be seen. There is a place of worship for Calvinistic Methodists, who have also a Sunday school, held in their meeting-house. The produce of two charitable benefactions, amounting to £1. 2. 6. per annum, is distributed among the poor. Llanvwrog (Llan-Fwrog) LLANVWROG (LLAN-FWROG), a parish, in the union and hundred of Ruthin, county of Denbigh, North Wales, ¼ mile (W.) from Ruthin; containing in the whole 1554, but, with the exception of that part in the borough of Ruthin, 333, inhabitants. This parish, of which the hamlet of Street extends into and forms part of the borough of Ruthin, is intersected by the turnpike-road from Shrewsbury, Oswestry, and Llangollen to Denbigh and St. Asaph, and likewise by that from Wrexham to the same places. It is bounded on the north by the parish of Llanynys, on the south by the parishes of Evenechtyd and Llanvair-Dyfryn-Clwyd, on the east by Llanrhûdd and Ruthin, from which it is separated by the river Clwyd, and on the west by the parish of Clocaenog. It comprises by admeasurement 3068 acres, of which about 2142 are arable, 446 meadow and pasture, and the remainder woodland. The scenery is rich and beautiful, embracing a great variety of surface, numerous little streams tributary to the river Clwyd, well cultivated fields, tracts ornamented with oak, ash, sycamore, elm, and larch, and several superior mansions, with views from the higher grounds in every direction of the most picturesque kind. Llanvwrog forms part of the fertile Vale of Clwyd, one side of which is inclosed by a sweep of high land, traversing the western boundary of the parish, and affording extensive and highly interesting prospects of the Clwydian range of hills beyond its eastern limits; this range runs from north to south, and forms the other boundary of the intermediate valley. Poole Park was at one time the seat of the ancient family of Salusbury, from whom it passed by marriage with the last heiress to Sir Walter Bagot, of Blythfield, in the county of Stafford. The property now belongs to Lord Bagot, who, in 1828, rebuilt the mansion in the Elizabethan style of architecture; it is a handsome edifice, and the pleasure-grounds, which are extensive and finely laid out, comprehend much beautiful and varied scenery. The soil is not naturally rich, partaking of the nature of the schistus upon which to a great extent it rests, but it is well cultivated, and produces grain of all kinds, potatoes, turnips, hay, &c., of very good quality; the eastern portion of the land that lies in the vale, and on a substratum of limestone, is richer and more fertile. An attempt was made to obtain lead-ore, for which purpose some works were erected at Coedmarchan, but they were not attended with any success. There are a few small limestone quarries, in which about twenty hands are occasionally engaged; and barytes is raised, which is ground for paint in a mill in an adjoining parish: a few men are employed in three tan-yards; and a soda-water manufactory, in considerable repute, affords occupation to about eight or ten persons. The living is a rectory, rated in the king's books at £16. 13. 4.; patron, the Bishop of Bangor: the tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £455, and the glebe consists of nearly four acres and a half, valued at £7 per annum. The church, dedicated to St. Mwrog, is situated in the township of Street, close to the river Clwyd. It is an ancient structure, containing some portions in the later style of English architecture in the eastern part, and having the piers and arches, that divide the body of the church into two equal parts, of much older date: the edifice has a tower and four bells, measures in the interior sixty feet by thirty-six, and will accommodate about 330 persons. There is a place of worship for Baptists; and two Sunday schools are held, one of them in connexion with the Established Church, and the other belonging to the Baptist denomination. An hospital here, having tenements for four poor men and six poor women, owes its foundation to Lady Jane Bagot, who, by will dated 1695, bequeathed the sum of £1000 to be laid out in the purchase of land for its endowment, and conformably with whose intentions certain lands in Merionethshire on the Bagot estate were by deed, in 1697, assigned to this purpose. The hospital was built in 1708, by Sir Edward Bagot, son of the foundress, who also materially contributed to its erection; and it was further endowed by her daughter, the Countess of Uxbridge, with the sum of £300. It appears by the Report of the Commissioners of Inquiry concerning Charities, presented to parliament, that the £1000, directed by Lady Bagot to be invested in land, were until lately treated by the Bagot family as money lying out at interest in their hands, in ignorance that the land in Merionethshire had ever been set apart for the hospital. The discovery, which, owing to the increased value of the land, considerably augmented the resources of the hospital, was made by the present Lord Bagot, who found the deed of 1697 among his muniments at Blythfield, Staffordshire; and his lordship most liberally agreed to pay over to the uses of the hospital the sum of £1900, and to confirm to it the property in question. The inmates of the almshouses have an allowance of £1 each per month, besides coal and clothing, and there is an annual surplus fund for repairs and various other contingencies. The income of the charity, which has been more than trebled by the restoration, now amounts to £164 per annum. The Rev. Hugh Pugh made a bequest of 40 s . to this parish in 1681, and gifts of the same amount to Llanbedr and the hospital at Ruthin; the land in which these sums were invested yields £18 a year, one-third whereof belongs to Llanvwrog, and is regularly distributed among the poor. Griffith Thomas ap Evan, about the same period, devised a small farm called Llidiart-vawr-lydan to the poor of this and three other parishes, from which this place derives £4 a year. The gifts of other benefactors are secured upon the Wrexham and Denbigh, and Ruthin and Mold trusts, and increase the funds for the poor of the parish to £16. 15. 6. per annum. Llanvyllin (Llan-Fyllin) LLANVYLLIN (LLAN-FYLLIN), a borough, market-town, and parish, and the head of a union, in the Lower division of the hundred of Llanvyllin, county of Montgomery, North Wales, 20 miles (N. N. W.) from Montgomery, 12 (N. W. by N.) from Welshpool, and 183 (N. W. by W.) from London; containing 1955 inhabitants. This place, which derives its name from the dedication of its church to St. Myllin, appears to have been of little or no importance prior to the time of Edward I., during whose reign several privileges and immunities were granted to its inhabitants. In September 1645, Charles I. passed one night here, and on the following day dined at Brithdir, whence he continued his route through Mochnant to Cevnhîrvynydd, and along the tops of the mountains to Chirk Castle. The town is pleasantly situated in a fertile valley, on the road from Shrewsbury to Bala, and is intersected by the small river Abel, which, uniting with the Cain, flows through the parish, and, pursuing its course through the adjoining parish of Llanvechan, falls into the Vyrnwy at Llansantfraid. It has been much improved within the present century, and a neat bridge has been erected over the Abel, which flows along the principal street; but, from its retired situation at a distance from any great thoroughfare, it possesses no commercial importance. The trade is principally in malt, for which there are several kilns; and some tanneries are carried on to a moderate extent. The parish comprises an area of about 8000 acres, of which about three-fifths are pasture, and two-fifths arable, with 200 acres of woodland; the ordinary corn and green crops are produced. All the waste lands have been inclosed by act of parliament; but many hundred acres still remain uncultivated. Between this town and Bôdvach was formerly a large turbary, from which the inhabitants were partly supplied with fuel; but it was converted into fertile meadows, at a considerable expense, by Bell Lloyd, Esq., father of the present Lord Mostyn, and on part of it has been erected a beautiful cottage, called the Vownog. The scenery is pleasingly varied, in many parts highly picturesque, and from the higher grounds are obtained some fine views over the Vale of Cain, and other valleys in the vicinity, eminent for the beauty of their scenery: Bôdvach, the seat of Lord Mostyn, and Llwyn, the property of William Humphreys, Esq., have each extensive plantations. The market, which is well supplied with corn and provisions of every kind, is held on Thursday in a convenient area under the town-hall. Fairs take place annually on the Wednesday next before Easter, on May 24th, June 28th, August 10th, October 5th, and December 8th, for horses, cattle, and wares; and sheep and pigs are exposed for sale on the day preceding each of the fairs, except those of August and December. The inhabitants received their first charter of incorporation from Llewelyn ab Grufydd ab Gwenwynwyn, in the time of Edward I. This charter was ratified by Edward de Charlton, lord of Powys, in the 6th year of the reign of Henry V.; by Henry Gray, Earl of Tankerfield and Powys, in the 26th of Henry VI.; and by Queen Elizabeth in the 5th of her reign. It invests the burgesses with power to take, imprison, and try thieves and other malefactors, and in the event of their escape, to pursue them in any direction, for a distance not exceeding a league from the town; and any stranger residing within it, and paying scot and lot for one year, could claim his freedom. The charter was extended by Charles II., in the 25th year of his reign, and the government of the borough then became vested in two bailiffs, a high steward, a recorder, and fifteen capital burgesses (including the bailiffs), assisted by a town-clerk, two serjeants-at-mace, and other officers; the burgesses, steward, and recorder to form a common council; and the style of the corporation to be, ""the Bailiffs and Burgesses of the Borough of Llanvyllin, in the County of Montgomery."" The bailiffs are chosen annually, one by the lord of the manor, and the other by the burgesses at large; and both are justices of the peace within the borough, of which the jurisdiction is co-extensive with the parish. The steward, recorder, and town-clerk are appointed by the owner of the Powys lordship; the coroner, by the steward and bailiffs; and the serjeants-at-mace, by the bailiffs alone. The freedom is inherited by the eldest sons only of freemen, on their attaining the age of twentyone, or conferred by gift of the bailiffs and capital burgesses. Llanvyllin was made to participate, in the 27th of Henry VIII., in the elective franchise, as a contributory borough with Llanidloes, Machynlleth, and Welshpool, in the return of a member for Montgomery, the county town. This privilege was confirmed by a resolution of the House of Commons, in 1680, but was afterwards denied in 1728, by another resolution, which disfranchised these boroughs in consequence of the inhabitants refusing to contribute towards the expenses of the member, namely, 13 s . 4 d . for each borough. Thus the right of voting was confined exclusively to the burgesses of Montgomery. The resolutions, however, being in opposition to each other, the burgesses, by an act of the 28th of George III., were empowered to assert their right of voting for a member for Montgomery before another committee of the house, and of appealing within twelve calendar months against any future decision. By the act of 1832, for ""Amending the Representation of the People,"" the elective franchise was restored to Llanvyllin, which, with Llanidloes, Machynlleth, Montgomery, Newtown, and Welshpool, unites in sending a member to parliament. The right of voting is vested in every male person of full age, occupying a house or other premises in the borough of the annual value of not less than £10, provided he be capable of registering as the act demands: the number of tenements of this value within the limits, which were extended by the act, and are minutely detailed in the Appendix to this work, including an area of about 500 acres, is about sixty. Llanvyllin is also one of the polling-places in the election of a knight for the shire. The bailiffs, steward, and recorder, or any two of them, of whom the capital bailiff or steward must be one, are empowered by the charter of King Charles to hold general quarter-sessions of the peace within the borough, in as ample a manner as the justices of the peace in and for the county; but this privilege is not now exercised. Petty-sessions both for the borough and for the hundred are held in the boardroom of the union-workhouse on the first Friday in every month; and courts leet and baron take place twice in the year, within a month of Easter and of Michaelmas; but the court baron does not at present exercise the jurisdiction to which it has a claim in the recovery of debts. The powers of the county debtcourt of Llanvyllin, established in 1847, extend over the whole registration-district of Llanvyllin, except two parishes. This court is held in the town-hall, situated in the principal street, a neat building of brick, containing in the upper story a commodious room, forty-five feet long and twenty wide, and affording underneath a convenient and sheltered area for the market. It was erected in 1789, at a cost of £1500, defrayed by the sale of waste lands under the provisions of an act obtained for that purpose upon the destruction of the old town-hall by fire, in 1775. The town-hall was lately repaired and appropriately fitted up as a court-room for holding the debt-court above noticed: the petty-sessions were formerly held in the building. A lock-up house, consisting of two rooms for the prisoners, and an apartment for the accommodation of the constable, was built in 1829, on ground purchased and presented to the county by the Rev. D. Hughes, rector of the parish, and a most indefatigable magistrate. The living is a rectory, rated in the king's books at £10. 13. 6½.; present net income, £485, with a glebe-house; patron, the Bishop of St. Asaph. The church, dedicated to St. Myllin, is a neat edifice of brick, erected in the year 1704, upon the site of a more ancient structure, which, having fallen into a dilapidated state, was taken down. The walls of the body of the edifice, as well as of the tower, which is also of brick, and contains a fine peal of six bells, are embattled, and surmounted with pinnacles; a number of neat pews afford accommodation to about 100 persons, and there are free-seats for 160. Here are places of worship for Independents, Baptists, and Calvinistic and Wesleyan Methodists. Mrs. Vaughan of Llangedwin, in 1720, bequeathed the sum of £1116. 10. in the lottery funds, to be invested in the purchase of land for the foundation and endowment of charity schools for twenty boys and ten girls of this place, and for twelve boys of the parish of Llanvihangel, who were also to be annually clothed. This sum, after having accumulated to £1220. 10., was laid out in mortgage on several estates in the county of Montgomery, belonging to Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, Bart., and produces an income to the charity of above £60 per annum. Mrs. Mary Strangeways, of the parish of Melbury, in Dorsetshire, daughter of Mrs. Vaughan, bequeathed £400, with which a tenement was purchased in Llaethbwlch, now producing a rent of about £60, for the support of the same schools. The total income from these endowments is £124, of which two-thirds are usually paid to the funds of the Llanvyllin charity schools, and one-third to the school at Llanvihangel. Until within the last few years, the schools at Llanvyllin also received the produce of a bequest made in 1713 by Henry Thomas, Esq., who left £100 towards establishing a school, which, from accumulated interest, yielded £8. 10. per annum; but the interest of this endowment is now withheld. Since the year 1820 the schools have been conducted on the National plan; the schoolrooms are situated near the church, and a considerable number of boys and girls are taught. There are several Sunday schools. Edward Lloyd bequeathed a rent-charge of £6, or a portion of land, the produce of which he directed to be distributed in money and bread. Charles Edwards, in 1717, left £50; Lewis Evans gave £20; Mrs. Jones, Holborn, £20; John Morris £10, and a piece of land, producing £1 rent; Evan Price, in 1787, £200; Griffith Morris £5; Anne Wynn £10; and John Griffiths, in 1722, £10: also for the benefit of the poor. The poor-law union of which this town is the head, was formed February 15th, 1837, and comprises the following parishes and townships; namely, Llanvyllin, Garth-Beibio, Hîrnant, Llandisilio, Llandrinio, Llanervul, Llangadvan, Llangyniew, Llangynog, Llansantfraid (hundred of Deythur), Llansantfraid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(hundred of Pool), Llanvair-Caereinion, Llanvechan, Llanvihangel, Llanwddyn, Meivod, and Pennant, in the shire of Montgomery; Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant, in the counties of Montgomery and Denbigh; and Carreghova, Llancadwaladr, Llanarmon-Mynydd-Mawr, and Llangedwin, in the county of Denbigh. It is under the superintendence of twenty-seven guardians, and contains a population of 20,445. The poor-house stands about half a mile from the town, on the left side of the road to Shrewsbury. In the hamlet of Bôdyddon," at a place called the """"Street", are some remains of a Roman road; and in the same division of the parish are an ancient British encampment, and a well named Fynnon Coedy-Llan , supposed to have been the well of St. Myllin, who is said to have lived near the spot. There are vestiges of several intrenchments in other parts of the parish; also the remains of a house, built in 1599, in which Lord Castlemain , ambassador from James II. to the pope, is said to have been concealed for some time after the Revolution by a family named Price , to whom he fled for an asylum. The altar-piece of the chapel in the house, and an exquisitely carved bookcase, removed from the mansion, are now at Brynaber, near Llanvyllin, to the owner of which the remains above-mentioned belong. Thomas Price , a member of the same family, a man of learning, and fond of antiquarian researches, formed a valuable collection of manuscripts, which is thought to have been deposited in the Vatican Library at Rome. There are several gentlemen's seats within the parish and in its vicinity, among which, in the hamlet of that name, is Bôdvach , a handsome mansion beautifully situated on the banks of the river Cain, and surrounded with thriving plantations; the grounds are tastefully disposed, and present much interesting scenery, commanding a fine view of the church and town of Llanvyllin. Near the town, on the other side, and at the entrance of the well-wooded Vale of Abel, which is watered by the river of that name, stands the splendid residence of Llwyn . At Dôl y Velin Blwm, near Llanvyllin, many tons of lead have been procured from the imperfectly reduced scoria of some ancient British smelting-hearths. The Rev. Thomas Richards , who was appointed rector of the parish, in 1718, by Bishop Wynne, published a folio volume of Latin Hexameters upon the death of Queen Caroline, consort of George I., which he dedicated to Bishop Maddox, clerk-of-thecloset to Her Majesty; he was an elegant scholar, and is said by Dr. Trapp, professor of poetry in the University of Oxford, to have been the best writer of Latin verse since the time of Virgil. Llanvynydd (Llan-Fynydd) LLANVYNYDD (LLAN-FYNYDD), a parish, in the union of Llandilo-Vawr, Lower division of the hundred of Cathinog, county of Carmarthen, South Wales, 6 miles (N. W.) from Llandilo-Vawr; containing 1358 inhabitants. This parish, which is of very considerable extent, comprising 11,000 acres, is pleasantly situated near the source of the river Sannan; and the river Cothy separates it on the north-west from the parishes of Brechva and Llanmihangel-Rhôsycorn: the lands are for the greater part inclosed and cultivated, and the soil is tolerably fertile. Fairs are held annually in the village on July 5th, August 13th, and November 19th. The place until lately constituted a prebend in the Collegiate Church of Brecknock, rated in the king's books at £18. The living is a discharged vicarage, rated in the king's books at £6. 13. 4., and endowed with £384. 14. 5. parliamentary grant; patron, the Bishop of St. David's. The tithes have been commuted for a rent-charge of £365, of which £243. 6. 8., or two-thirds, are payable to the impropriator, and £121. 13. 4., or one-third, to the vicar. The church, dedicated to St. Egwad, is not entitled to architectural notice. There are places of worship for Calvinistic Methodists and Baptists. A school was endowed in 1738, by the Rev. David Jones, with the sum of £300, to be laid out in the purchase of messuages and lands within the county of Carmarthen," and the rents to be applied """"for the better augmentation of the school", and fixing a salary or stipend for the master, for furnishing the poor children with books, and to settle them apprentices to some trade, for keeping the premises and other additional buildings therein to be made from time to time in sufficient repair, and for buying Welsh Bibles for the poor inhabitants of the parish; that the charitable design begun, and hitherto carried on, by the said David Jones," might hereafter be effectually"""" carried on and continued. These are the words of the trust-deed of the school"," which goes on to say that """"the sum of £6 shall be paid to the master yearly for ever", for teaching twelve poor children, either boys or girls, or both," from the age of seven."""" The money thus left was duly invested in land", the proceeds of which amount to £39. 5. per annum; the master receives from this endowment a stipend of £12, and the remainder is applied in apprenticing fees, the purchase of books, and in keeping the buildings in repair: the schoolroom and master's dwelling-house have been of late years rebuilt. There are about forty children on the books, and the master, besides his house and garden, has about £10 a year in school-pence. Several Sunday schools are also held. The poor participate in the rents and profits of a farm, and a few pieces of land, in Llanegwad parish, bequeathed by Maud Watkins, in 1685; the proportion for Llanvynydd being thirteen guineas, which sum, with two teals of barley, principally the gift of David Harry ab Evan, in 1658, is shared among about 120 persons, selected immediately before Christmas. Near the left bank of the Cothy, are the remains of an ancient fortress of considerable extent and elliptical form; and there are several cairns and monumental stones scattered through the parish. Llanvyrnach (Llan-Fyrnach) LLANVYRNACH (LLAN-FYRNACH), a parish, in the union of Newcastle-Emlyn, hundred of Kemmes, county of Pembroke, South Wales, 8 miles (S. W.) from Newcastle-Emlyn; containing 1049 inhabitants. This parish, which derives its name from the dedication of its church, is situated in the north-eastern part of the county, bordering upon Carmarthenshire, and comprises 6000 acres of land, the greater portion inclosed and cultivated. The surrounding scenery, though not characterized by any peculiarity of feature, is generally pleasing, and in some instances picturesque; the soil is inferior in fertility to that of other parts of the county, but is tolerably productive. A large common, connected with Percelly mountain, rises to the west of the village, but an inclosure of land was made in the parish not many years since. On the banks of the river Tâf, and at no great distance from its source, are some extensive lead-mines, which were formerly wrought with great success: but the works have been some time suspended. The living is a discharged rectory, rated in the king's books at £10, and in the patronage of the Lord Chancellor, with a glebe-house: the tithes have been commuted for £251, of which £245 are payable to the rector, and £6 to an impropriator. The church, dedicated to St. Brynach, is not remarkable for any architectural details. There are places of worship for Independents and Baptists; a day school, and four Sunday schools. On the common above the church are four large erect stones, visible at a great distance, marking out, according to tradition, the graves of two chieftains who were slain in a desperate battle, said to have been fought near that spot; and in the immediate vicinity of the church is a large tumulus, which is supposed to have been surmounted by a castle, or fort, to defend the pass. There are several mineral springs within the parish, but their peculiar properties have not been ascertained. Llanwddyn, or Llanouddyn (Llan-Owddyn) LLANWDDYN, or LLANOUDDYN (LLAN-OWDDYN), a parish, in the union, and Upper division of the hundred, of Llanvyllin, county of Montgomery, North Wales, 12 miles (W. by N.) from the town of Llanvyllin; containing 593 inhabitants. This place, which was formerly a chapelry, dependent on the adjacent parish of Llanrhaiadr-yn-Mochnant, is said to derive its name from a giant named Wddin, or Owddyn, who was born here; and on the neighbouring hills is a spot called Gwely Wddin," or """"the bed of Wddin", where he is supposed to have lived. Other accounts, with more probability, describe Wddin to have been an anchoret, who had a cell among the rocks here, in which he dwelt in seclusion and retirement. It is affirmed, on the authority of an absurd local tradition, that immense treasures are concealed in the parish, and that all attempts to discover them have been frustrated by incessant storms. The path of Wddin, when he went to visit St. Monacella, whose cell was at Pennant Melangel, on the other side of the mountain, five miles distant, is still pointed out, and called by his name. The parish comprises 19,400 acres, of which 13,600 are common or waste land. The vale in which the village is situated is about five miles in length, and varies from half a mile to a mile in breadth; it is frequently covered with water during the winter months, but, if drained, would be one of the most picturesque and fertile in this part of the principality. The village occupies a pleasant site near the river Owddyn, a tributary of the Vyrnwy, and nearly at the north-western extremity of the county, in a sequestered spot sheltered by mountains on both sides. Within the parish are two slatequarries, one at Gallt Vorgan, near Rhiw Argor, which has been worked for some time; the other at Lluestwen, about two miles south-westward from the village, opened in 1830: the quantity of slates raised is very inconsiderable, and, though the mines are capable of producing a vast amount, must necessarily remain so till better roads are made for conveying the produce to the surrounding districts. Attempts to procure lead-ore have been repeatedly made at Cynon Isâv and other places, but without sufficient success to remunerate the adventurers. Fairs are annually held in the village on May 8th and October 2nd, principally for cattle and horses. The living is a perpetual curacy, endowed with £400 royal bounty, and £1000 parliamentary grant; net income, £100, with a glebe-house; patron, the Earl of Powis. The tithes have been commuted for £227. 17., of which a sum of £164 is payable to his lordship, £62. 17. to the Dean and Chapter of St. Asaph, and £1 to the parish-clerk. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is an ancient structure that belonged to the Knights Hospitallers: in the churchyard are some remarkably fine yew-trees. There are three places of worship for Calvinistic Methodists, and one for Wesleyans, with a Sunday school held in each of them. Mr. David Humphreys, in 1721, bequeathed £30; Ellis Davies, the elder, £15, in 1809; and Ellis Davies, the younger, £10 some years since, to the poor; the interest of which is annually distributed according to the will of the testators. An unknown donor gave £5, to be divided among the psalm-singers of the parish. Llanwenllwyvo (Llan-Wenllwyfo) LLANWENLLWYVO (LLAN-WENLLWYFO), a parish, in the hundred of Twrcelyn, union and county of Anglesey, North Wales, 5 miles (E. S. E.) from Amlwch; containing 524 inhabitants. It is situated on the coast of the Irish Sea, and partakes much of the general character of dreary sterility by which the mining districts in the immediate vicinity are distinguished, though in some parts the scenery displays features of fertility and even of romantic beauty. Many of the inhabitants are employed in the Parys and Mona copper-mines, in the adjoining parish of Amlwch. Llŷs Dulas, the property of Lord Dinorben, is a spacious mansion standing in extensive grounds, within which the parochial church forms a conspicuous and interesting object. The Traeth Dulas, or Dulas sands, at the mouth of the river Dulas, stretch along a part of the shore here, and form a small bay, while other portions of the coast are bold and precipitous; within a short distance is the island of Ynys Gadarn. The living is a perpetual curacy, in the gift of the incumbent of Amlwch; the Bishop of Bangor is proprietor of certain tithes, which have been commuted for a rent-charge of £172. 19., but in half of the parcel called Rhôs-y-Mynach the tithes belong to the rector of Llaneilian. The church, dedicated to St. Gwenllwyvo, is a small neat edifice, appropriately fitted up. There are two places of worship for Baptists, one for Calvinistic Methodists, and one for Wesleyans; with a Sunday school held in each of them. About 1826 John Parry bequeathed a sum of £50, the interest to be divided annually on Christmas-eve among ten poor persons: having been invested on the security of the tolls of the road from Beaumaris to the Holyhead post-road, it now yields an interest of £2. 10., annually distributed among aged women. A small benefaction of £2, by Robert Prichard, in 1705, has been lost. Llanwenog (Llan-Wenog) LLANWENOG (LLAN-WENOG), a parish, in the union of Lampeter, Upper division of the hundred of Moythen, county of Cardigan, South Wales, 5¼ miles (W. S. W.) from Lampeter; containing 1578 inhabitants. This parish is distinguished as the scene of a memorable battle fought in 981, between the Danes under their famous leader Godfrid, and the native Welsh under Eineon ab Owain, in which the former were totally defeated; or, according to Sir S. R. Meyrick, between Eineon and his countryman Hywel ab Ievan. A square intrenchment in a field called Cae'r Vaes," or """"the field of battle", on the farm of Tŷ Cam, is still pointed out as a spot where the engagement took place. The parish is situated on the road from Lampeter to Cardigan, and bounded on the north by Llanwnnen, on the south by Llandyssil, and on the east by the river Teivy, which separates it from the county of Brecknock. It comprises by computation 9000 acres of arable and pasture land, the greater portion inclosed and in a good state of cultivation, producing chiefly oats and barley. The scenery, though not characterized by any extraordinary features, is in general pleasing, and is enlivened by the small stream Cledlyn, which runs through the middle of the parish, and by several good residences. Llanvaughan , a handsome, though deserted, mansion, now the property of the nieces of the late Admiral Thomas, who erected it in 1786, is beautifully situated in grounds laid out with great taste, and abounding with a rich variety of ornamental scenery. The admiral was a native of the parish, and a member of the family of Lloyd, of Castell Hywel. High Mead , another seat, is delightfully situated on an eminence above the river Teivy, commanding an extensive prospect of the surrounding country on both sides of the vale, which here expands into considerable breadth. The house is completely sheltered from the north winds by a range of lofty hills, the summits and acclivities of which are planted with woods of luxuriant foliage, containing fir, ash, sycamore, and oak trees, that add much to the beauty of the scenery. A fair is held on January 14th. This place constituted a prebend in the ancient Collegiate Church of Llandewy-Brevi, rated in the king's books at £17. 12. 11. The living is a discharged vicarage, endowed with £600 parliamentary grant; patron, the Bishop of St. David's. The parish is divided into two parts, called respectively the Freehold-land and the Grange: the Grange portion of the tithes is divided into three lots, of which one belongs to Major Evans, of High Mead, and the other two are added to the Freehold-land portion; and the Freehold tithes, including this addition, are apportioned in three equal shares to the High Mead and Crosswood estates, and the vicar. The whole tithes have been commuted for £412. 6. payable to the impropriators, and £147. 14. to the incumbent. The church, dedicated to St. Gwynog, is an ancient structure, with a massive tower sixtysix feet high, and contains 600 sittings, nearly the whole of which are free: over the western door of the tower is a stone with armorial bearings and an inscription, supposed to be in Saxon letters, which cannot be deciphered. There were formerly one or two chapels of ease to the mother church; no chapel is now standing, but according to tradition one was situated between Llanvaughan and the farm of Dolwolf, called Capel Santesau," """"the saintesses' chapel."""" The dissenters have some places of worship in the parish; and two Sunday schools are held", both of them by the Independents, to whom one of the meeting-houses belongs. Among the remains of antiquity is a monumental stone, with an inscription in rude characters," which Sir S. R. Meyrick reads """" Trenacatus hic jacet filius Maglagni ;"""" this stone was dug up beyond the village of Rhuddlan", on a farm called Crug-y-wheel, and is now a gate-post leading into the garden of Llanvaughan. Two tumuli situated near the river Teivy, are supposed to have been originally thrown up and crowned with forts, to defend the passage of the river; and there is a barrow named Crûg-yr-Udon, on Bwlchmawr farm, which, on being opened, was found to contain a coffin of glazed earth, in which were human bones placed in an upright position. There was also not long since another relic of antiquity, called Carn Philip Gwyddyl," """"the cairn or barrow of Philip the Irishman", a curious bank of earth, six yards in length and four feet high, resembling in form the rude sketch of a prostrate human figure, without the head, and with the arm stretched out. It was situated in a field not far from the church, and is reported by tradition to have marked the burial-place of a freebooter, who lived in the tower of the church, and who, on leaping from it when closely pursued, broke his leg and was captured. There is another barrow on the farm of Bryn-yrHogvaen, called Crûg-y-Pendwll," meaning """"a heap in which a hole is made to throw heads in."""" Some earthen pots were dug up a short time since", full of human bones, which looked black, as if they had been half burned. The Rev. David Lloyd, a poet of minor celebrity, was interred at Llanwenog, but no monument has been erected to his memory. Llanwinio (Llan-Wyno) LLANWINIO (LLAN-WYNO), a parish, comprising the Eastern and Western divisions, in the Lower division of the hundred of Derllŷs, union and county of Carmarthen, South Wales, 13 miles (W. N. W.) from Carmarthen; containing 1035 inhabitants, of whom 422 are in the Eastern, and 613 in the Western, division. This parish, which derives its name from the dedication of its church, lies near the western extremity of the county, on the border of Pembrokeshire, and comprises a large tract of land, the greater portion inclosed and cultivated. It is watered by the small river called Avon Gynin. The country is diversified, and the distant views comprehend some fine combinations of mountain scenery and luxuriant pasture lands in the vicinity; the soil is fertile, and the inhabitants are chiefly employed in agriculture, and in tending flocks of sheep. The village is pleasantly situated. An annual fair for sheep is held on the 12th of November. The living is a perpetual curacy, endowed with £400 royal bounty and £1600 parliamentary grant, and in the patronage of Mr. Howel, to whom the impropriation belongs; net income £83. The church, dedicated to St. Gwyno, stands near the right bank of the Avon Gynin river. There are places of worship for Baptists, Calvinistic Methodists, and Independents; and four Sunday schools, belonging to the dissenters. Llanwnda (Llan-Wyndaf) LLANWNDA (LLAN-WYNDAF), a parish, in the hundred of Uwchgorvai, union and county of Carnarvon, North Wales, 3 miles (S. by W.) from Carnarvon; containing 1586 inhabitants. The name of this place is derived from the dedication of its church to St. Gwyndav, who flourished during the sixth century. The parish is situated on the turnpike-road from Carnarvon to Pwllheli, and is bounded on the north by the parish of Llanbeblig, on the south by that of Llandwrog, on the east by that of Bettws-Garmon, and on the west by the sea. It comprises 8000 acres, about one-fourth of which is arable, and the rest a dreary, mountainous tract of rocky ground, covered only by a very thin layer of earth. The lower portion has a loamy soil, producing oats, barley, and a little wheat, and is ornamented with the windings of the river Gorvai, which separates the parish from Llanbeblig, and with sprinklings in various places of oak, ash, and alder trees. Slate of excellent quality is found among the mountains, and very considerable quarries have been opened; but from the difficulty of conveying the produce to any shipping-place, they are not wrought to their full extent. Large quantities of copper-ore have also been discovered, but so mixed with iron as to require great labour and expense in separating it, for which reason the works are not carried on to any advantage. The tramroad from Llanllyvni to Carnarvon passes near the south side of the churchyard, but does not appear to have been made available for the exportation of the mineral produce of the parish, by the construction of any collateral communication with the quarries or the mines. The village is small, and chiefly inhabited by persons employed in the quarries and in agriculture. The living consists of both a rectory and a vicarage. The rectory, which is a sinecure, is annexed to the headship of Jesus' College, Oxford: the vicarage, which is discharged, and to which the perpetual curacy of Llanvagdalen is annexed, is endowed with £400 royal bounty, and in the patronage of the Bishop of Bangor; total net income of the vicar, less than £200. The tithes of the parish have been commuted for £370 payable to the principal of Jesus' College, and £90 to the vicar. The church is an ancient structure, measuring in the interior fiftyone feet by seventeen, and containing accommodation for between 300 and 400 persons. The chancel is lighted by three lancet-shaped windows, and the edifice displays some good specimens of architecture; there are also some monuments of the Baron-Hill family. Here are places of worship for Independents, and Calvinistic and Wesleyan Methodists. A National school was maintained for a long period at the sole expense of the curate, but it has been discontinued. A small school-house was built many years since, on the north side of the church, and some bequests were made for teaching children, but they have been lost. There are three Sunday schools, two of them appertaining to the Independents, and the other to the Calvinistic body. Mrs. Ellen Williams, in 1714, left £200 for the augmentation of the vicar's stipend, and £100, the interest of which she directed to be distributed among the poor annually. The Rev. Lewis Jones, in 1692, bequeathed £100, directing a moiety of the interest to be divided among twelve aged men or women, and a rent-charge of £3, to be divided among twelve natives of the parish, or, in default of such, among inhabitants of seven years' standing. Near the farm of Bôdaden, some slight traces of a Roman road are still discernible, pointing to the ancient Segontium near Carnarvon. There are likewise some remains of two British fortifications, called respectively Yr Hên Castell and Dinas Gorvan or Gorvai, the latter probably deriving its name from its position on the river Gorvai. Of the former, but very slight vestiges are discernible; and the latter, which is situated near Pont Newydd, has been so much damaged by the action of the rapid stream of the Gorvai, during times of flood, against its base, that the upper part has fallen, and only a portion of the foundations can now be distinguished. The Rev. Mr. Farringdon, who employed a considerable portion of his time in antiquarian pursuits, was for some years vicar of the parish. Llanwnda (Llan-Wyndaf) LLANWNDA (LLAN-WYNDAF), a parish, in the poor-law union of Haverfordwest, hundred of Dewisland, county of Pembroke, South Wales, 2½ miles (N. W.) from the town of Fishguard; containing 1045 inhabitants. This place appears to be of remote antiquity, and the adjoining district is supposed to have been a favourite resort of the Druids. That it was a principal station for the solemnization of their rites is plainly indicated by the number of Druidical remains that are scattered over the parish and throughout the vicinity, and also from various adjacent spots," which still retain the names """"Llan Druidion"," """"Fynnon Druidion", and others of similar import and origin. Near Fynnon Druidion were found five instruments of flint, considered to have been used in flaying the victims devoted to sacrifice; and in the vale below is a circular earthwork, marked out by a solitary erect stone, probably thrown up to defend the pass of a small stream by which it is skirted, and perhaps also to protect the avenue to the consecrated region. According to tradition, an ancient town called Trêv Culhwch existed here at a very early period, of which evidence is frequently obtained in the foundations of old buildings that still obstruct the plough, in various parts of the farm on which it is thought to have been situated. About the year 1076, Trehaern ab Caradoc, Prince of North Wales, led his forces into South Wales, for the purpose of subjecting this country to his dominion, and at Pwllgwttic was boldly encountered by Rhŷs ab Owain, the reigning prince, with all the forces he could levy. Here, after a long and sanguinary conflict, Rhŷs was at length defeated, with the loss of most of his army; and being himself closely pursued by the victor, he was at length taken prisoner with his brother Howel, and both were put to death by Trehaern in revenge for the murder of Bleddyn ab Cynvyn, which they had previously committed. No other events of importance are recorded in connexion with the parish. The French effected a landing on this part of the coast in the year 1797, but after plundering the inhabitants for some time, the soldiers becoming insubordinate through excess," their commander found it necessary to make an unconditional surrender to the local forces brought against him by Lord Cawdor. The spot where the troops encamped on landing is still called """"The French Encampment."""" The parish is situated in the north-western part of the county", and bounded on the north by St. George's Channel, and on the east by Fishguard bay, forming a promontory with a bold and precipitous shore, and indented by several small bays, the soundings within half a mile of the coast being from seven to twenty fathoms. The scenery is diversified with features of romantic grandeur; and the views from the higher grounds embrace extensive prospects over the Channel, and the adjacent country, which abounds with objects of interest. Off the north-western coast, in Carregonnen bay, are two small islets of a similar name. The living is a discharged vicarage, rated in the king's books at £3. 5. 2½., and endowed with £600 royal bounty, and £400 parliamentary grant; present net income, £220; patrons and appropriators, the Dean and Chapter of St. David's. The church, dedicated to St. Gwyndav, is not distinguished by any architectural features of importance. There are places of worship for Baptists and Calvinistic Methodists; a day school in connexion with the Established Church; and three Sunday schools, one of which is conducted on Church principles. William Hugh, in 1778, bequeathed £20 to the poor not receiving parochial relief; but the sum is supposed to have been expended in the payment of £2 annually among them, without creating any endowment permanently. A strong chain of well-connected forts, extending in a direction from east to west throughout the whole length of the parish, is said to be of British origin: that on Garn Vawr rock comprises an extensive area, inclosed by strong ramparts of uncemented stones, on the most accessible parts, flanked with portions of the rock which project in the form of natural bastions. On the summit of the hill above Goodwick pier is a rocking-stone, weighing about five tons, and so nicely poised as to yield to the slightest pressure. A little beyond it are three remarkable cromlechs in a right line, of which two have been overturned, but one still preserves its original position. Another cromlech stands on the ledge of rock just above the village; the table stone is thirteen feet in its greatest length, more than nine feet and a half in its greatest width, and of an average thickness of two feet. To the west of the site of Trêv Culhwch are the majestic remains of several other cromlechs, one of which, more perfect than the rest, has a table stone fifteen feet long, eight feet wide, and two feet and a half in thickness. On opening a cairn, in 1826, for the purpose of widening a road near the sea, in the parish, a brass instrument was discovered, about nine inches long, with a circular ring at one end, and a flat triangle at the other, and pierced with two round holes in the neck that connected these together: no satisfactory conjecture has been offered as to the use to which it was applied. Near Trêv Asser, in the parish, is a tumulus surrounded with a moat, which, on being opened some time since, was found to contain fragments of urns, and other indications of its having been a place of sepulture. Trêv Asser is said to have been the birthplace of Asser, the friend and biographer of Alfred the Great. The celebrated Giraldus Cambrensis, who attended Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, while preaching the crusades throughout the principality, and who is known for his literary works and numerous ecclesiastical appointments," was for some time incumbent of the parish.""",unknown,,25.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,https://www.british-history.ac.uk/topographical-dict/wales/pp147-157,,,68d650fabc331b3ef2108495e1d4ab4d,,FALSE,,,,,post,0,,140000,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:17.851+0000,84,,,,,forum,Forums,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Forums,,,BW_CRAWLED_FORUM
